Why some applications are processed faster than others Under assessment Your application and all your documents are ready to be assessed, so we can make a decision whether to approve a visa or not. Your application will be assessed, but this might not occur immediately. The time it takes to assess applications depends on how many other applications we have received and are assessing. During this stage, we may contact you if we need any further information. Note For AEWV applications based on a reused job token, we will generally only start processing an application when your current AEWV expiry date is within the next 9 months, or as our processing capacity allows. Further information required This means we need more information from you before we can make a decision on your application. There will be a letter in your dashboard explaining what we need.

        "main_content": "There are many factors that can slow down a visa application. In some cases there are actions you can take to speed up the processing of your visa application. Information about your application Check your application status To find out information on your visa application status you can log in to your Immigration Online account and check your visa status. Checking your visa application status Check if we have emailed you We may have emailed you asking for more information and have had no response. For example, we may have asked for more medical information or photos. Check the email account you used for your visa application and search for emails from Immigration New Zealand. Tip Make sure to also check your junk and spam folders. Complex vs straightforward applications Complex applications One reason your application might be taking longer than expected is if your application is complex. These are some of the factors that can make your application complex: You are applying to come to New Zealand for the first time. You or someone included in your application have medical issues or a history of medical issues. Your application is part of a group application. We are waiting on information from others, for example, organisations that provide international qualification information or police certificates. Your application has information that requires further review. For example, your travel history, or links and circumstances in your home country. Your previous travel to New Zealand raised concerns with us. For example, you stayed in New Zealand after your visa expired. You or someone included in your application have declared character issues, and we are assessing if you are of good character. Good character for temporary visas Straightforward applications If your application is straightforward, it is more likely that we will be able to process it within the timeframes we advise. How long it takes to process an application A straightforward application: includes all required evidence has no mistakes or typos within the application shows that you have genuine intentions to visit, study or work in New Zealand. Genuine intentions to visit, study or work in New Zealand Other factors that can affect processing times If you have a sponsor If you are applying for a Visitor Visa online and your application is being sponsored, your sponsor must complete an online form. We cannot process your application until your sponsor completes this form. Check in with your sponsor. Find out if they have completed the online form and, if not, remind them to do so. Process to become a sponsor Evidence provided with your application Only include evidence that we ask for in your application. If you include additional evidence that we have not asked for this can slow down the processing time for your visa. If you have provided evidence with your application that is in the wrong format, outdated or that is not in English, this could also slow down the processing time for your visa. File formats for uploading documents and photographs Providing English translations of supporting documents Your visa application could also be slowed down if you have sent us your original passport. If you applied for your visa online you only need to provide a photo of your passport, not the original. Providing your passport for online applications AEWV applications based on a reused job token For AEWV applications based on a reused job token, we will generally only start processing an application when your current AEWV expiry date is within the next 9 months, or as our processing capacity allows. Maximum continuous stay and longer visa length for the AEWV Peak seasons Some visa types have more applications than normal at certain times of the year. Visitor visas October to February We get more Visitor Visa applications during this period as this is when New Zealand's summer is. This means that more tourists want to come here during this time. Student visas November to March We get more student visa applications during this period because the academic year for New Zealand universities normally starts in February or March."

        "header": "Home New Zealand visas Waiting for a visa Escalation for urgent applications Escalation for urgent applications Request to have your application allocated urgently for assessment using our visa escalation process.",
        "main_content": "How we allocate applications We usually allocate applications for visas, employer accreditation and Job Checks by the date we receive them, from the oldest first. When we allocate an application, it means we assign it to an immigration officer to start assessing it. How long it takes to process an application In some cases you can make a request for urgent allocation, so we can allocate your application as a priority to an immigration officer. This request is called an 'escalation request'. We follow our visa escalation process to assess your request. Visa escalation process If you meet the all the criteria, you can send an email to make an escalation request. Your request goes to our visa escalation team to assess. The team will let you know if your request is accepted or not. Check if you can submit an escalation request Check if you can make a visa escalation request Note We do not consider travel bookings alone to be a reason for urgent allocation. We usually cannot accept escalation requests for applications submitted less than 5 days ago. This is to give enough time for the application to be properly entered into our system. If we have already assigned your application to an immigration officer, we cannot escalate it because it is already being assessed. Criteria for an escalation request Your escalation request must have a compelling or very important reason for your application to be allocated urgently. This includes: compelling personal and business circumstances humanitarian factors, and matters of national interest. Other requirements There are additional requirements and criteria for some applications. Check the following situations. Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) balance Applications for the AEWV balance with a reused job token go into a queue. We will generally only start processing AEWV balance applications when the current AEWV expiry date is within the next 9 months. If your application is in the queue, escalation requests for you and any partner or children are unlikely to meet the requirements for escalation, as your visas are still valid for 9 months or more. Applying for your AEWV balance Student visas Note You must include information that shows your application meets our criteria for escalation. The start date of your study alone is unlikely to meet our criteria. Escalation criteria We will consider the following when evaluating escalation requests for student visas: The time of application – did the student apply in good time (at least 6 weeks before the intended travel date) The intake or start date of the programme of study, and Any matters of national interest, significant personal or business circumstances or humanitarian factors. We are currently receiving a large number of escalation requests and not all are able to be accepted. Consider the specifics of the case before submitting an escalation request, and make sure you provide as much information as possible. Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa, Straight to Residence Visa, and Work to Residence Visa On 29 September 2023 we changed how we prioritise skilled residence applications. This affects Work to Residence, Straight to Residence and the Skilled Migrant Category Resident visas. We will allocate your application for processing before other skilled residence applications if you meet any of the following criteria. You have an occupation on the Tier 1 Green List. You are paid 3 times the median wage . You are a Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa applicant with 6 points without work experience. Read the Amendment Circular for more details. Amendment Circular 2023-35 Wage rate requirements for visas You can make an escalation request for these visa types if you meet any of these criteria. You must still meet all other criteria for an escalation request. Supporting visa applications for your partner or dependent children If you are supporting a partner or dependent child's visa application, you can only request an escalation for their visa after your visa application has been approved. You must still meet all the criteria for an escalation request. Visitor visa or Permanent Resident Visa The visa escalation team does not assess email requests for urgent allocation of a visitor visa or Permanent Resident Visa. This is because of the large number of requests we get. How to request urgent allocation for these visas depends on if you are from the Pacific or outside the Pacific. Applications from the Pacific If you are from the Pacific and need to request urgent allocation for a visitor visa or Permanent Resident Visa, contact our Pacific visa escalations email address: pacificvisaescalations@mbie.govt.nz You must still meet all other criteria for an escalation request. The countries and territories in the Pacific are: American Samoa Cook Islands Federated States of Micronesia Fiji French Polynesia Kiribati Marshall Islands Nauru New Caledonia Niue Papua New Guinea Samoa Solomon Islands Tonga Tuvalu Vanuatu Applications from outside the Pacific If you are from outside the Pacific and need to request urgent allocation for a visitor visa or Permanent Resident Visa, call the Immigration Call Centre: Contact us You must still meet all other criteria for an escalation request Make your escalation request If you meet the criteria for an escalation request, you can send your request to our escalations team. Who can make a request To make an escalation request for your application, you must be: the main applicant on the application form, or the legal representative or licensed immigration adviser for the main applicant. How to make a request Send your request to: visaescalations@mbie.govt.nz You need to include: applicant's first name and last name application number applicant's passport number applicant's date of birth applicant's INZ client number — if you know it why you need the application urgently allocated — explain why there are compelling or very important personal circumstances, humanitarian factors, or matters of national interest documents of evidence supporting your request. We assess your escalation request When we assess escalation requests, we check that there are: compelling or very important personal circumstances humanitarian factors, or matters of national interest. We look at: the information in the request including any supporting documents, and the circumstances of the application. We let you know if your request is accepted or declined The visa escalation team will email you to let you know if your request is accepted or not. This normally takes 2 to 5 working days. If we accept your request, we will let you know in the email when we are likely to start assessing your application. You can check your visa application status at any time. Checking your visa application status We escalate your application If we accept your request, we allocate your application as a priority to an immigration officer. Note If we accept your escalation request, it does not mean we will also approve your application. It also does not mean the time we need to assess your application will be shorter. We assess all applications using our normal processes, criteria and times.

Check your passport You may not be allowed to check in if your passport is not valid for travel to New Zealand. Check that it will not expire until: 3 months after the date you plan to leave New Zealand, or 1 month after the date you plan to leave New Zealand — if your passport was issued by a country that has a New Zealand embassy or consulate that issues passports of that country. Embassies - Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Trade If you live in New Zealand permanently — for example, if you have a resident visa — your passport only needs to be valid for travel to New Zealand.

You should apply for another visa at least 1 month before your current visa’s expiry date. How long it takes to process a visa application If you stay after your visa expires You are breaking the law if you stay after your visa expires. You: cannot work or study, and will have no access to health care may not be able to come back to New Zealand again if you are here without a visa for 42 days or longer risk being detained or deported. Your actions can also affect other people. For example, if family members or other people help you to stay in New Zealand they: commit an offence under the Immigration Act 2009, and may put their own immigration status at risk. Warning The longer you stay after your visa expires, the greater the risk you run of being deported and of not being able to return to New Zealand in the future. Actions you can take after your visa expires If you are still in New Zealand after your visa expires, you can: leave the country immediately, or make a request for a special temporary or resident visa under section 61 of the Immigration Act 2009, but only if you believe you have a special case. Making a Section 61 request Requests under section 61 are only granted in some cases. We cannot grant you a visa under section 61 if a deportation order has already been issued to you. Section 61 of the Immigration Act 2009: Grant of visa in special case - New Zealand Legislation How to make a request Put your request in writing and email it to: s61@mbie.govt.nz Explain your circumstances as fully as possible and attach to your email any evidence to support your request. Do not provide credit card details with your request. We will contact you for payment once your request is assessed and we decide to grant you a visa. In your request include: your personal details — your name, date of birth and Immigration New Zealand (INZ) client number your contact details — email address, phone number and postal address an explanation of why you are still in New Zealand after your visa has expired — for example, tell us why you could not return to your home country or go to another country to apply for a new New Zealand visa details of your personal circumstances, such as your family or work, that support your reasons for wanting to stay in New Zealand how staying in New Zealand could contribute to our country, particularly if you would like to stay here for a long time what type of visa you would like — for example a visitor or study visa — and how long you would like to stay. Supporting documents When you email your request attach a copy of the personal details page in your passport. There are no other documents you must provide, but it is recommended to attach copies of any supporting evidence to back up any claims in your request. How we assess your Section 61 request The process for assessing a Section 61 request is different from assessing a visa application. All requests are handled by a senior immigration officer at the INZ Manukau Area Office. Under the law, the officer has no obligation to consider your request and does not have to: provide any reasons for their decision make any enquiries about the information you provide in support of the request or about other information Immigration New Zealand (INZ) holds about you grant a visa of the type or length you asked for — for example, they can give you a visitor visa instead of a work visa grant a specific visa even if you seem to meet the criteria for that visa. How long it takes to assess your request Each case is different and there is no time frame for assessing Section 61 requests. If we refuse your request You must leave New Zealand immediately. If you do not depart voluntarily, we can serve you with a deportation order and deport you. Deportation liability and appeal rights Appealing the decision You cannot appeal a Section 61 decision. You can apply to the High Court for judicial review of the decision, but the judge can only consider Immigration New Zealand's decision-making process and not your circumstances. If we approve your request We approve your request in principle. You must pay the correct fee for your visa, and for anyone else included in your request, before we issue your visa. Use our online 'Fees, decision times and where to apply' tool to find out what you will pay for your visa if we approve your request in principle. Search for 'section 61' and select the visa type that applies to you. Fees, decision times and where to apply We will contact you to ask for the fee."

        "main_content": "Immigration makes a vital contribution to New Zealand’s economy, workforce and community. It reunites friends and families, provides employers with access to key skills and capital, contributes to New Zealand’s international and humanitarian commitments, and supports the security and integrity of our border. Since New Zealand’s border opened after COVID-19, interest in visiting and working here has rebounded significantly. 2023 was the first full year of the border being open since COVID-19 and the volume of work across the immigration system shows just how integral immigration is to New Zealand. In the 2023 calendar year: more than one million visas were decided. there was unprecedented demand from people wanting to visit New Zealand, with the record of applications submitted being broken on a number of months and more than 505,000 Visitor Visa applications decided. more than 1.5 million NZeTA requests were decided. 46,500 Working Holiday applications were decided. nearly 83,000 Accredited Employers work visa (AEWV) applications were decided and around 15,700 employers became accredited under the AEWV policy. more than 85,000 student visas were decided. 1,507 refugees were able to call New Zealand home through New Zealand’s Refugee Quota Programme. there were 10 successful immigration related convictions in 2023. 529 investigations into immigration breaches were carried out, including 239 cases with allegations of migrant exploitation that were investigated. Who we are The primary role of the New Zealand immigration system is to facilitate the travel of visitors, students, workers, families and refugees to New Zealand, and protect New Zealand from immigration risk. Immigration New Zealand (INZ) is the operational processing arm of New Zealand’s immigration system and has four core roles: We grant visas to people who New Zealand needs to work, visit, study, or settle here. We ensure that people crossing the border and staying in New Zealand are entitled to do so. We help migrants and refugees to make New Zealand their home. We play our part in the global immigration system, together with our border partners to keep New Zealand safe. INZ sits within the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and is just one part of the wider immigration system. The immigration system also includes MBIE’s compliance centre of expertise (Te Whakatairanga Service Delivery) who carry out onshore investigation and compliance activity, provide services to license people who provide New Zealand immigration advice, and provide customer support through MBIE’s Customer Service Centre. The immigration system works within the policy framework set by the Immigration Act 2009, associated regulations and immigration instructions authorised under the Act. MBIE’s immigration policy function supports Ministers to make changes to immigration policy settings through Cabinet or Parliament. INZ works closely with the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, other border agencies, and our international partners, in particular other Migration 5 countries (Australia, Canada, United States and the United Kingdom).  This allows us to identify risk, improving the integrity of the immigration system. International cooperation Our ambition INZ’s ambition is to provide a trusted, world class immigration service for all our customers. We aim to strike the balance between facilitating the entry of the people New Zealand needs to work, visit, live or study here and protecting New Zealand from immigration risk. INZ is committed to being a customer-centric organisation that is simple to engage with, helps to keep our customers safe and provides certainty for them. We want to ensure our customers know what the visa process means for them and make it easy to apply for a visa and comply with their visa obligations. We want to make sure our customers know when they can expect a decision on their application. We also want customers to know what New Zealand offers them so they can thrive while they’re here. What our customers can expect INZ has worked to better understand what customers need so we can improve our online forms and information. We are continuing to improve our online platform and move more visa categories online. This will allow customers to track their application’s progress in real time. INZ receives high volumes of visa applications. All applications are assessed against the relevant immigration requirements in a fair and transparent way. The time it takes to decide an application may vary depending on the type of application, the applicant’s circumstances and whether the application has all the necessary information and documents. Processing visa applications often takes longer when applicants have not submitted all the required information in their application or during visa peak periods. In order to reduce delays, we ask all visa applicants or their licensed immigration advisers and representatives to: understand fully the visa criteria or seek further advice from a licensed immigration adviser or lawyer if it is not clear, before submitting a visa application. submit all the required application documentation and evidence in full when applying. be aware of the processing times for the visa and allow plenty of time for the application to be processed. to be sure, don’t plan, book or confirm any immediate non-refundable or non-changeable arrangements in New Zealand until the outcome of the visa is confirmed. INZ has information on processing timeframes for each visa category. As these timeframes can change, usually due to high demand in peak periods, we ask customers to plan accordingly and make sure they are applying in plenty of time.

        "main_content": "7 April 2024 7 minute read The Government is making changes to the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV). What is changing for people with an AEWV If you currently have an AEWV, these changes could affect how long you can stay before you need to spend time outside New Zealand or your eligibility to be granted a further AEWV. If you applied for your first AEWV before 21 June 2023 and are in an ANZSCO level 4 and 5 job paying at or above the required AEWV wage rate, and currently hold a three year AEWV, you will no longer be able to access the maximum time of five years. If you are in an ANZSCO level 4 and 5 job on a pathway to residence, you will not be affected by changes to the maximum continuous stay and visa duration. If you apply for a further AEWV on or after 7 April 2024, you will have to meet the updated criteria. If you are in an ANZSCO level 4 and 5 job you may not be able to stay and work in New Zealand for the maximum time of five years. How long you can stay on an AEWV What is changing for new AEWV applications There are now higher work experience and qualification requirements, a standard of English for people applying to work in roles assessed as ANZSCO skill level 4 and 5, and a shorter stay in New Zealand if you are working in specific roles. New minimum skill requirement If you are applying for an AEWV you will need to show evidence of your work experience or qualifications. This is in addition to the skills and qualifications that your employer has identified as necessary for the job and your employer will need to check you meet the skill requirements before they offer you the job. Unless your role is on the Green List and meets the Green List role requirements, or is paid at least twice the median wage, you must now have: at least 3 years’ relevant work experience, or a relevant qualification at level 4 or above of the New Zealand Qualifications and Credentials Framework (NZQCF). Evidence of your qualification must be accompanied by an International Qualification Assessment (IQA) if it is below Bachelor’s degree level. To meet the work experience requirement, you must provide evidence proving you did the work — you cannot include documents that you wrote. Accredited Employer Work Visa Minimum standard of English If the job is ANZSCO level 4 or 5, you need to show that you can speak and understand English. This requirement will not apply to current applications, or to people travelling as the partner or child of AEWV applicant. English language requirements for the Accredited Employer Work Visa Shorter visa length and stay in New Zealand for some jobs For ANZSCO level 4 and 5 jobs paying at or above the required AEWV wage rate, the maximum visa length for an AEWV is reduced to 2 years, with the ability to apply for one more year with a new Job Check. The total time you can stay in New Zealand (also called a maximum continuous stay) on one or more AEWVs is reduced to 3 years. When you get to the end of your maximum continuous stay you will need to leave New Zealand for a specified amount of time — normally 12 months — before you can apply for another AEWV. These changes will apply to anyone who applied for their first AEWV on or after 7 April 2024 or before 21 June 2023. Some ANZSCO level 4 and 5 jobs will not be affected by these changes, including those: on the Green List in transport and care sector agreements, and on a pathway to residence earning 1.5 times the median wage. The length of an AEWV and maximum continuous stay for people in ANZSCO level 1 to 3 jobs will remain 5 years. How long you can stay on an AEWV What is changing for employers The requirements employers must meet to hire migrants on the AEWV have changed. There are now more requirements at the accreditation and Job Check stages and during the accreditation period. There are also higher work experience and qualification requirements for AEWV applicants, a standard of English for people applying to work in roles assessed as ANZSCO skill level 4 and 5, and a shorter stay in New Zealand for those working in specific roles. Meeting your AEWV accredited employer obligations Ensure an applicant is suitably qualified and skilled Employers must now take reasonable steps to ensure migrants are suitably skilled before sending them a job token. Employers will need to check that the migrant has the skills they have identified as necessary for the job, as well as the new minimum skill requirement being introduced as part of these changes. These requirements must be met for all Job Check applications. Employers who are accredited or re-accredited from 7 April 2024 will need to take reasonable steps to ensure migrant workers meet skill requirements as part of their accreditation obligations. Check your migrant is suitably qualified Employ migrants for at least 30 hours From 7 April 2024, new AEWVs will be issued with a condition requiring you to employ migrants for at least 30 hours per week. If you do not provide at least 30 hours a week's employment we can revoke your accreditation. Grounds for suspending accreditation being expanded Employers being actively investigated for any breach of accreditation may have their accreditation suspended. Previously, suspension was only an option for breaches of some accreditation requirements. Now using ANZSCO skill levels Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) skill levels are being introduced into the assessment of AEWV applications. Check the ANZSCO list Suitable and available New Zealanders There is now a definition of 'suitable and available New Zealanders'. Employers will be required to declare that nobody who applied for the job met the definition. If an employer indicates that there were suitable New Zealanders available, the Job Check will be declined. Advertise a job and engage with Work and Income Extra rules for ANZSCO level 4 and 5 jobs Employers wanting to fill jobs at ANZSCO level 4 and 5 now need to: advertise for 21 days, rather than 14, engage with Work and Income, and declare in the Job Check why any New Zealanders who applied were not hired. Employers must engage with Work and Income before making their Job Check application. If you did not hire a New Zealand applicant who met the definition of suitable and available, your Job Check will be declined. Advertise a job and engage with Work and Income Tell Immigration New Zealand when a migrant leaves their job A new accreditation requirement is being introduced for employers. If a worker on an AEWV leaves your employment a month or more before their visa expires, you must tell Immigration New Zealand (INZ) within 10 working days. If you fail to do this we may revoke or suspend your accreditation. This change will not apply to existing accredited employers until they renew or upgrade their accreditation. Meeting your AEWV accredited employer obligations Franchisee accreditation changing late-2024 Franchisee accreditation will end later in 2024. Franchisee employers will be able to apply for standard, high-volume, or triangular employment accreditation, depending on their circumstances.

Your rights as a migrant worker You have the same minimum rights as any other worker in New Zealand when it comes to: holidays leave work breaks wages written employment agreements. Minimum rights of employees — Employment New Zealand Examples of migrant worker exploitation Examples of migrant exploitation are when: your employer bullies or threatens you someone keeps your passport and money from you you cannot leave your workplace because the doors and windows are locked you must ask permission to eat, sleep, or go to the toilet you have no time off from work you are paid too little money or none at all your employer forces you to work to pay off a debt your employer threatens to harm you or your family if you do not do as you are told. Go to the Employment New Zealand website to see what migrant exploitation means and for more examples. \n Migrant exploitation — Employment New Zealand How to help keep yourself safe from exploitation It is illegal for your employer to take your passport from you. Keep copies of your passport and visa in your home country with family or friends. In New Zealand, keep your passport and other travel documents in a safe place. Write down the phone number of your home country’s embassy in New Zealand and keep it handy. \n Embassies — New Zealand Foreign Affairs & Trade Your employer must provide you with a written employment agreement covering the terms and conditions of your employment. Keep this in a safe place. Understand the work conditions of your work or student visa. For example, does it list who you can work for or a maximum number of hours you can work each week? Note down all the hours and days that you work, the amounts and dates that you are paid, and any amounts taken from your payments by your employer. Try to get your wages paid into a personal bank account that only you or another authorised person can access. This protects your money and can help you keep track of your wage payments. Protecting yourself from immigration scams For people planning on coming to New Zealand, we have a list of immigration scams to watch out for. The information is in 11 languages. \n Protect yourself from immigration scams What to do if you feel you are being exploited If you are in immediate physical danger, call 111 and ask for Police. Do not be afraid to ask for help. You will be protected and treated fairly. Action can be taken against the employer. Make a report about exploitation By reporting migrant exploitation, you may be eligible for the Migrant Exploitation Protection Work Visa (MEPV). This 6-month visa lets you: quickly leave the employer who is exploiting you remain lawfully in New Zealand while there is an investigation into the exploitation. You can report migrant exploitation to Employment New Zealand using their online form or by phoning them.

If you want to report anonymously, do not include your contact details. It is important that you provide accurate and truthful information in your report and work with Employment New Zealand if there is a case against your employer. Do not be afraid to report exploitation Your employer knows that you may be afraid of reporting your exploitation at work, especially if you are: working when your visa does not allow you to in New Zealand unlawfully because your visa has expired worried you will have to leave New Zealand. Some employers use this fear to take away your rights. This is wrong. The New Zealand Government wants to stop employers from exploiting migrants. We want you to report any exploitation at work. Do not be afraid to ask for help. Immigration New Zealand (INZ) and Employment New Zealand will treat you fairly if you tell us about your exploitation at work. Exploitation is a serious crime Employers who exploit migrants can be imprisoned for up to 7 years and be fined up to NZD$100,000. They can also be punished for failing to meet their obligations as an employer. What happens after reporting exploitation If you provided contact information, Employment New Zealand will get in touch with you and: confirm the information you gave them, and let you know how they can help. Employment New Zealand can give you advice and, where suitable, connect you with the support services you need for everyday life in New Zealand.

Apply for the Migrant Exploitation Protection Work Visa (MEPV) The Migrant Exploitation Protection Work Visa (MEPV) is free and allows you to stay in New Zealand for up to 6 months. We treat your application as high priority. It allows you to leave your current employer quickly while we investigate the exploitation. While on this visa, you can work for any employer anywhere in New Zealand. You must have a current work visa with the name of your employer on it. You cannot apply for this visa if you hold a work visa that is not linked to an employer (such as a working holiday visa or a Post Study Work Visa). Report your exploitation to Employment New Zealand Reporting migrant exploitation — Employment New Zealand Phone 0800 200 088 (The phone number is free to call from any landline or mobile in New Zealand.) If you do not speak English, Employment New Zealand can provide information in your language. When you call and you connect with their operator, say the language you speak. Stay on the line and they will get an interpreter to join the call. Do not end the call while you are being connected.

Apply for your MEPV within 1 month of getting your assessment letter You do not have to pay fees or provide medical or police certificates when you apply. This visa will be granted for up to 6 months depending on the time remaining on your current visa. If your partner or dependent children already have a visa, their visa and conditions will not change if you have a MPEV. When you hold a MEPV and your partner or dependent child need a further visa, they must already be holding a visa based on their relationship to you to be eligible.

In your application you can include a partner and dependent children aged 19 years and younger. Dismissed Worker Visitor Visa Job offers and applying for a Job Change If you have a job offer from a different employer, you can apply for a Job Change. This changes your AEWV conditions to let you work for a new employer. You still have to leave New Zealand before your visa ends.

Getting the Job Change Cost is NZD $210. Check what to do if you hold an AEWV or another work visa with specific conditions. Application for a Job Change Request a section 61 visa if yours has expired You are breaking the law if you are in New Zealand after your visa expires. It is called being unlawfully in New Zealand.

What is changing? From 1 October, new visa charges will be set at an appropriate level to recover the costs of processing a visa and reflect the benefits received by people using immigration services. Immigration makes a vital contribution to New Zealand’s economy, workforce and community. It reunites friends and families, provides employers with access to key skills and capital, contributes to New Zealand’s international and humanitarian commitments, and supports the security and integrity of our border. It is appropriate that those using and benefiting from the immigration system cover the costs of running it. Visa charges Table with the new visa charges: Immigration fee and levy table — rates from 1 October 2024 PDF 356KB It is important to note, not every international visitor needs a visitor visa to come here with the majority of international visitors coming from visa-waiver countries and are not required to pay visa charges. Pacific visas New Zealand’s ongoing commitment to supporting its Pacific neighbours will see the continuation of subsidised fees for visa applicants from Pacific countries. ESOL programmes People using the immigration system will now fund 80 percent of costs for English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) programmes in schools. The Government will continue to fund the remaining 20 percent.

If you move to the NZD$28.25 an hour rate, you can apply for a further AEWV to get the maximum continuous stay of 5 years. For workers paid NZD$28.25 an hour, this gives you time to apply for residence after you have completed the required 2 years of work experience while being paid NZD$28.25 an hour. Applying for your AEWV balance You may be able to apply for the balance of the your visa, if you have time remaining on your maximum continuous stay.

They must still meet a lower wage rate requirement. Sectors covered by sector agreements: care workforce seafood processing (onshore) seafood (sea-based) construction and infrastructure meat processing seasonal snow and adventure tourism transport. Note The seafood (sea-based) sector agreement allows for migrant workers to be paid under the February 2023 median wage. These workers are not hired on the AEWV, instead, they are employed on the Fishing Crew Work Visa. Fishing Crew Work Visa Wage exemptions The tourism and hospitality sector has a temporary exemption that allows them to pay less than the February 2023 median wage rate for some roles for a limited time. Recruitment limits Some sectors also have limits set on how many migrants they can recruit. In the sector agreements they are called 'capped' sectors. Sectors that do not have limits on recruiting migrants are called 'uncapped' sectors. Uncapped sectors The uncapped sectors are: care workforce tourism and hospitality construction and infrastructure seasonal snow and adventure tourism transport. Capped sectors Capped sectors have a limit on how many workers they can hire and pay below the February 2023 median wage each year. The capped sectors are: meat processing: 320 workers each year seafood processing (onshore): 600 workers each year. The allocation of these caps is carried out by the Meat Industry Association (MIA) and Seafood New Zealand. MIA and Seafood New Zealand contact employers through industry channels with further information on getting a share of the cap. You can contact MIA or Seafood New Zealand for more information about the cap. MIA: sectoragreement@mia.co.nz Seafood New Zealand: application@seafood.org.nz Setting sector pay rates The government sets the pay rate after consulting with relevant government agencies and sector representatives. The pay rates are different for each sector due to varying labour market conditions. Maximum continuous stay for AEWV roles Maximum continuous stay is the total time a person can be on an AEWV before they must spend time outside New Zealand to be eligible for another AEWV. There is a maximum continuous stay for everyone who has an AEWV. How long you can stay on an AEWV You can check the visa length, maximum continuous stay and the time required outside New Zealand for AEWV roles exempt from paying the February 2023 median wage. AEWV roles exempt from paying the February 2023 median wage Sector agreements and pathways to residence Some roles covered by a sector agreement provide a pathway to residence. This means the migrant worker can apply for residence once they have completed work experience in New Zealand. Unless there is an exception in place, visa holders wanting to claim work experience as part of their residence application must be paid at least: the median wage in place when their visa application was accepted, and the current median wage when they apply for their residence visa. Work experience exceptions and median wage exceptions Migrants covered by the Care Workforce agreement must be paid at least NZD$28.25 an hour during their work experience. Care Workforce Work to Residence Visa Changes were made to the Transport Work to Residence on 7 April 2024. From 7 April 2024, migrants applying for an AEWV as a bus driver will no longer be able to use this role to gain work experience towards a Transport Work to Residence Visa. Bus drivers who had their AEWV application accepted on or before 6 April 2024 can continue to gain work experience and apply for a Transport Work to Residence Visa once they meet the visa requirements. They must be paid at least NZD$28 an hour during their work experience. Transport Work to Residence Visa work requirements and roles Changes to Work to Residence and occupations on the Green List Sector agreement improvements Sectors are expected to work towards a more productive and resilient workforce, by reducing their need for migrant workers. The expectations are different between the sector agreements, but in general sectors are required to: increase investment in worker training, upskilling, and career development improve domestic worker attraction and retention numbers increase investment, where appropriate, in new business models and labour-saving technology. In addition to these expectations, sectors also must put in place Workforce Transition Plans and Industry Transformation Plans. Sector agreements and staff shortages The sector agreements are not intended to resolve labour shortages. The sector agreement arrangements help give these sectors, which have traditionally relied on lower-paid migrants, time to make changes to their business and transition their workforce to rely less on migrant workers. Government monitoring of sector improvements Government will monitor progress on the expectations and this monitoring will be used in the 2024 reviews and development of Pacific programmes. The details of this monitoring are still being worked through with the Ministry of Business Innovation and Enterprise (MBIE) and the sector agencies.

        "main_content": "What is a wage threshold Wage thresholds are rates we use to calculate entitlement to some visas. The wage threshold is the lowest amount you can be paid to be granted the visa, unless your role has an exemption. We use wage thresholds as an indicator of the skill level of the job. The rates are updated regularly. If the threshold for your visa increases you will not need to meet the new rate unless you want to apply for a new visa and you need to: meet a different, higher wage threshold gain work experience while being paid the higher wage threshold. For information about how this works see: \n New Zealand skilled residence pathways Median wage rate Some wage thresholds in the immigration system are indexed to the New Zealand median wage. When the median wage increases, the wage threshold for the visa will increase. We update the median wage threshold by using the June median wage from the previous year published by Stats NZ. Labour market statistics (income): June 2023 quarter — Stats NZ All wage rates shown on here are hourly rates and are in New Zealand dollars.

Pay thresholds for the different visa types Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) AEWV jobs must pay at least NZD$29.66 an hour if the visa was granted after 27 February 2023, unless an exemption applies through a sector agreement. There is currently also a time-limited exemption for some tourism and hospitality roles. This threshold is based on the median wage published by Stats NZ in June 2022. \n Labour market statistics (income): June 2022 quarter — Stats NZ If a job pays at least twice the February 2023 median wage, the employer does not need to advertise the job as part of their Job Check. We approve a pay range at the Job Check stage, which must be at or above the pay threshold. The actual pay rate on the visa is determined at the visa application stage. How we calculate pay rates for the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) If you have an AEWV, you may be able to support a visa for their partner or dependent child. If you can support a visa and the type of visa of visas you can support will depend on your job and how much you earn. Bringing family if you have an AEWV AEWV sector agreements Some industries have an agreement, known as a 'sector agreement', that allows them to pay below the AEWV wage threshold when hiring a worker on an AEWV.

It makes an assessment and writes an IQA report. Check the requirements of the visa you are applying for to see if you need to get an IQA report for your qualification or credential. Most overseas qualifications and credentials currently require an IQA report completed by the NZQA. Explore visa options Note In 2020, the NZQA changed the name from New Zealand Qualifications Framework (NZQF) to New Zealand Qualifications and Credentials Framework (NZQCF). Immigration New Zealand uses both terms. How to apply for an IQA and a report You can apply online to NZQA for the type of IQA report that you need. The NZQA: verifies and assesses your overseas qualification or credential names the New Zealand qualification or credential that are similar sends you an IQA report.

Apply for an International Qualifications Assessment (IQA) — NZQA Qualifications that do not need an IQA The NZQA works to assess overseas qualifications and credentials and decide if an IQA is needed. Qualifications that do not need an IQA are then added to the list of qualifications exempt from assessment (LQEA).

Some of the visas on these pathways allow you to apply for residence straight away, such as the Straight to Residence Visa.

People need to meet specified requirements for their pathway, along with standard requirements in areas like age, English language, health, and character. Fig. 1: Summary of skilled residence pathways Full size image Detailed description of image Figure 1 shows a summary of the skilled residence pathways available when the new Skilled Migrant Category takes effect in October 2023. It illustrates the residence options available under the Skilled Migrant Category, Green List and sector agreements pathways, including the amount of work experience in New Zealand needed before people can apply for their respective residence visa. This visual representation particularly helps people who may qualify under multiple pathways, so they can determine the pathway that suits them best. Skilled Migrant Category pathway You can apply if you have an acceptable job or job offer in New Zealand and 6 points. The infographic shows that you can achieve 6 points in 4 different ways. You can receive 6 points if you have: New Zealand registration in a specified occupation, requiring at least 6 years’ training, or a PhD or doctorate, or a job or job offer in New Zealand which pays at least 3 times the median wage. Any 1 of these is worth 6 points and you can apply for the Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa with no skilled work in New Zealand. You can receive 5 points if you have: New Zealand registration in a specified occupation, requiring at least 5 years’ training, or a Master’s degree. Either of these is worth 5 points. You can receive an additional point for 1 year’s skilled work in New Zealand on any work visa. With this, you will have 6 points, and you can apply for the Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa. You can receive 4 points if you have New Zealand registration in a specified occupation, requiring at least 4 years’ training, or an Honours Degree or Post-graduate Diploma, or a job or job offer in New Zealand which pays at least 2 times the median wage. You can receive an additional 2 points for 2 year’s skilled work in New Zealand on any work visa. With this, you will have 6 points, and you can apply for the Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa. You can receive 3 points if you have: New Zealand registration in a specified occupation, requiring at least 2 years’ training, or a Bachelor’s Degree or Post-graduate Certificate, or a job or job offer in New Zealand which pays at least 1.5 times the median wage. You can receive an additional 3 points for 3 year’s skilled work in New Zealand on any work visa. With this, you will have 6 points, and you can apply for the Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa. Green List pathway The image shows 2 ways to apply for residence through the Green List. If you have a job offer for an occupation on the Tier 1 list and you meet the specified qualification, registration, and wage requirements, you can apply for the Straight to Residence Visa. If you have a job or job offer for an occupation on the Tier 2 list and you meet the specified qualification, registration, and wage requirements, you will need 2 years’ relevant work in New Zealand on a specified visa. After this you can apply for the Work to Residence Visa. Care Workforce and Transport Sector Agreements pathways If you have a job or job offer for an occupation in a specified sector agreement, and you meet the specified qualification, registration, and wage requirements, you need 2 years’ relevant work in New Zealand on a specified visa. After this you can apply for the Care Workforce Work to Residence Visa or Transport Workforce Work to Residence Visa. Straight to Residence Visa You can apply for this visa if you work for an accredited employer or you have a job offer from an accredited employer and your role is on Tier 1 of the Green List. If you are eligible you can apply for this visa now. You can either come to New Zealand on a work visa and apply or apply from overseas. Check the visa information for more information on eligibility and how to apply. Straight to Residence Visa Work to Residence Visa You can apply for this visa if you work for an accredited employer and you have worked in a Tier 2 Green List role for 24 months. You must be paid the current median wage when you apply for your Work to Residence Visa. Claiming work experience for your Work to Residence Visa During your 24 months work experience, you must have been paid either: at least the median wage that was in place when your current visa was granted, or the specific rate for your role. Some visas allow you to be paid less than the median wage, for example the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) which uses the February 2023 median wage. If your visa was granted using a pay rate lower than the median wage, you cannot start counting that time towards your work experience. For example, if your visa was granted after 28 February 2024, your job must pay at least NZD$31.61 (the current median wage) to be included towards your 24 months work experience. If your pay increases to pay at least the current median wage, you can start counting time towards your Work to Residence work experience. Example Prasad was granted an AEWV in April 2024 as a Teacher of the Sight Impaired. His AEWV was granted based on the pay rate of NZD$29.66 an hour (the February 2023 median wage). He will not start gaining work experience to use towards a Work to Residence Visa. In December 2024, Prasad's pay increases to NZD$34.19 an hour. He will start gaining work experience for a Work to Residence Visa from December 2024. Example Mei was granted an AEWV in December 2023 as a Telecommunications Technician. She is paid NZD$36.35 an hour (the specific rate for her role on the Green List). Mei can count work experience from December 2023. Check the visa information for more information on eligibility and how to apply. Work to Residence Visa Care Workforce Work to Residence Visa You must have been paid at least NZD$28.25 an hour during your work experience. Claiming work experience for your Care Workforce Work to Residence Visa You may be able to use work experience in other roles to make up the 24 months. It must be: in Tier 2 of our Green List of in-demand roles a transport sector role, or a role that paid at least twice the median wage. Check the visa information for more information on eligibility and how to apply. Care Workforce Work to Residence Visa Transport Work to Residence Visa You can apply for this visa if you work for an accredited employer and you have worked in a transport sector role for 24 months. You must be paid at least the current median wage when you apply for your Transport Work to Residence Visa, unless you are a bus driver. Claiming work experience for your Transport Work to Residence Visa During your 24 months work experience, you must have been paid at least: the median wage that was in place when your visa was granted, or NZD$28 an hour if you are a bus driver covered by the transport sector agreement. Some visas allow you to be paid less than the median wage, such as the Accredited Employer Work Visa which uses the February 2023 median wage. If your visa was granted based on a rate lower than the median wage, your work experience will not be included towards your work experience. There is an exception for bus drivers who can earn NZD$28 an hour during their work experience. If your pay increases to meet the current median wage, you can start counting time towards your Transport Work to Residence Visa. Example John was granted an AEWV in November 2023 to work as a bus driver. His AEWV was granted based on the transport sector agreement rate of NZD$28 an hour. His 24 months work experience will start being counted from November 2023. Example Elizabeth was granted an AEWV in March 2024 as an aircraft refueler. Her AEWV was granted based on the February 2023 median wage of NZD$29.66 an hour. In June 2024, Elizabeth's pay increases to NZD$31.61 an hour. Her 24 months work experience will start being counted from June 2024. Note that some roles were removed from the transport Work to Residence pathway on 7 April 2024. Transport Work to Residence Visa work requirements and roles Check the visa information for more information on eligibility and how to apply. Transport Work to Residence Visa Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa This visa is for people who have skills that will contribute to New Zealand's economic growth. You must have a job or job offer in skilled employment in New Zealand. Your job must pay at least the median wage. You need 6 points to apply for the Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa. This can be made up from: 3 to 6 points based on New Zealand occupational registration, qualifications, or income, and 1 point for each year of work experience in New Zealand in a skilled job, up to a maximum of 3 points. Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa Claiming skilled work experience points for your Skilled Migrant Category Visa During your skilled work experience, you must have been paid at least the wage threshold that was in place when your visa was granted. If your job has an ANZSCO level of 1 to 3 you must earn the median wage or above. If your job has an ANZSCO level of 4 to 5 you must earn 1.5 times the median wage or above. If you will be claiming points for your income, you need to earn that income over your work experience. For example, if you earn 1.5 times the median wage you can claim 3 points from your income. You must earn 1.5 times the median wage during each year of your skilled work experience. Skilled work experience starts counting from whenever you started earning the wage threshold. It will not stop counting if the wage threshold increases and you remain in your current job. If you change jobs you will need to meet the current wage threshold. Some visas allow you to be paid less than the median wage. If your visa was granted based on a rate lower than the median wage your work experience will not be included towards your skilled work experience. Example Leon has an AEWV and has been working in a skilled job that pays NZD$64.88 an hour. Because he is paid at least twice the new median wage, he can claim 4 points from his income. He has been working in this role for 2 years and has been earning $64.88 this entire time (at least twice the median wage). He can claim 2 points for skilled work experience. Leon can claim 6 points based on his income and his work experience, so he can submit an expression of interest for a Skilled Migrant Category Visa. Example Kylie is granted an AEWV in July 2024 for a role that pays the February 2023 median wage. Kylie works in this role for 1 year. She cannot use this time to claim points for work experience for a Skilled Migrant Category Visa. Other visa options Check our website to find out what other visa options may be available to you.

        "main_content": "Biometric information INZ confirms the identity of a person by comparing a photograph or fingerprint to a stored version. Facial recognition using a person’s photograph is the most common use of biometric information. In certain circumstances we may use DNA sampling. The benefits of biometrics to New Zealand New Zealand uses biometrics to counter identity fraud. Fraud may hide a criminal record or be used falsely to claim refugee status. Immigration fraud damages New Zealand because it displaces genuine immigrants. It is expensive and time-consuming to fix. Detecting fraud using biometrics: reduces the cost of managing our border enables early detection of fraud improves public safety by limiting the ability of criminals and terrorists to slip through. How Immigration New Zealand uses biometric information The Immigration Act 2009 (the Act) enables Immigration New Zealand (INZ) to gather biometric information. INZ collects both photographs and fingerprints to: identify and check the identity of foreigners seeking resettlement help identify refugees under New Zealand’s quota programme identify and check people under investigation at the border record the identity of deportees and stop them re-entering New Zealand under another identity identify and check people suspected of breaching the Act expose assumed identities. We tell you when we intend to collect your biometric information. You’ll have the opportunity to see the information and the right to dispute its accuracy. The Act requires us to collect your biometric information when you apply for a visa. If you refuse, we can reject your application. Although New Zealand citizens provide facial identity through their passports, INZ never collects their fingerprints. Biometric information sharing New Zealand is a member of the Five Country Conference (FCC). That’s an international agreement to exchange information on immigration matters. Its members are: New Zealand Australia United Kingdom Canada The United States The FCC shares fingerprint information to detect immigration and identity fraud. When one member asks for fingerprint information from another, the receiving country destroys the fingerprint if it finds no match. Members do not share biographical data like names or personal details unless they match a fingerprint. They don’t share their own citizens’ data. Information that members share can support prosecution and deportation of individuals.

We keep PNR data for 3 years, unless it is needed for specific investigative purposes. Airlines only provide PNR data that is specified in the Immigration (Carriers’ Information Obligations) Regulations 2010. The airlines and New Zealand's border agencies (INZ, the New Zealand Customs Service and the Ministry of Primary Industries) have agreed a standard for the collection of PNR data that aligns with international conventions agreed by the airline industry. When PNR data is collected Airlines must provide PNR data at the following intervals before the scheduled departure of any flight to or from New Zealand: 72 hours before departure 12 hours before departure 2 hours before departure 1 hour before departure, and on departure. We can ask for additional data at different time frames for specific investigative purposes. How we use PNR data We analyse PNR data as part of general border management. We check that all travellers have a lawful reason for coming here and identify people who: are not complying with New Zealand’s immigration laws, or may present a threat or risk to New Zealand's security, public order or public interest — for example, through serious offending such as terrorism, drug trafficking, identity fraud or people smuggling. Disclosure of passenger information Where necessary, we disclose APP and PNR data to other government authorities in New Zealand and overseas, in particular to law enforcement agencies. Disclosure is carried out in accordance with the Immigration Act 2009 and Privacy Act 2020. How we store APP and PNR data Data is stored using modern security practices including strong data encryption and appropriate access controls. We ensure that all data we collect, including an individual’s personal information, is collected, stored, used and disclosed in accordance with law, including the Immigration Act 2009, the Immigration (Carriers’ Information Obligations) Regulations 2010, and the Privacy Act 2020.

For an Accredited Employer Work Visa or Visitor Visa, if we need you to have a chest X-ray or medical examination, we give you an Immigration New Zealand health case reference number (NZHR). Give the NZHR to the clinic when you make your appointment.

A nurse or health care assistant may complete parts of the examination. You will need to: remove some items of clothing for the physical examination provide a urine sample during the medical examination get blood tests, and possibly a chest X-ray or other tests if needed — the clinic will tell you if you need these, and you may need to go to different places to get some tests done.

The Minister of Immigration decides whether to grant this visa.",
        "main_content": "What is international surrogacy International surrogacy is when a child is born to a surrogate mother overseas. The surrogacy arrangement can be a commercial or altruistic one. Legal parents Under New Zealand law, the birth mother and her partner, if she has one, are considered to be the legal parents of the child. Even if you and/or your partner are genetically related to the child or are identified on the birth certificate, you are not considered the legal parents under New Zealand law. You can learn more about international surrogacy on the Oranga Tamariki website. Surrogacy and adoption | Oranga Tamariki Temporary visitor visa for your surrogate child If you want to bring a child born through an international surrogacy agreement to New Zealand, you will need a temporary visitor visa for the child. There is no immigration policy to facilitate the entry of children born through an international surrogacy agreement. However there is an agreed process that allows the Minister of Immigration to consider a temporary visitor visa for such children on a case-by-case basis. To start the process of getting a temporary visitor visa you will need to contact Oranga Tamariki. Oranga Tamariki will contact us directly to facilitate the referral to the Minister of Immigration. The Minister of Immigration will make a decision on whether or not to grant the visa. They will consider factors such as whether the child has a genetic connection to you or your partner, what is in the best interest of the child, New Zealand's obligations to other countries, and the nature of the surrogacy arrangement. You can find the full list of things the Minister of Immigration will consider in the New Zealand Government's international surrogacy factsheet. International surrogacy factsheet DNA tests You may need to provide us with DNA tests. We will let you know if these are needed. You must pay for these tests and it can take up to 8 weeks from contacting the clinic to receiving the test results. You may need to remain in the country of your child’s birth until you get the test results. Residency and citizenship Because the birth mother and her partner are considered to be the legal parents, the child will not be eligible for New Zealand residence. However the child will be eligible for New Zealand citizenship if they have been adopted by a New Zealand citizen or resident. Before the process of surrogacy and adoption begins, the adoptive parents must contact Oranga Tamariki and the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) to ensure the process follows all relevant New Zealand laws. Information for parents and lawyers International surrogacy is a complex area of immigration law. The process of getting a child born through an international surrogacy agreement to New Zealand involves other government agencies and processes. If you are a New Zealander who is considering commissioning a surrogacy overseas you should get independent legal advice. You should also contact Oranga Tamariki, DIA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Trade (MFAT). Immigration New Zealand is part of a whole-of-government approach for surrogacy matters. Check the factsheet on international surrogacy for more information. This factsheet is produced jointly by Immigration New Zealand, Oranga Tamariki, DIA and MFAT. International surrogacy factsheet"

        "main_content": "What your AEWV balance is Your Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) balance is the length of time you have left to stay in New Zealand on a new AEWV after your current AEWV ends. The total length of time you can stay in New Zealand on one or more AEWVs — also called a maximum continuous stay — is up to 5 years depending on your role, pay and when you got your first AEWV. How long you can stay on an AEWV To apply for your balance You need to apply for a new AEWV and pay a new visa application fee. Your employer must send you a link to apply for a new AEWV — also called a job token. Note You must meet all requirements for the AEWV when applying for your balance, including new English language and skill requirements introduced on 7 April 2024. Accredited Employer Work Visa If you applied on or after 7 April 2024, you cannot reuse a job token to apply for your AEWV balance. You must use a new job token instead. Reusing a job token You may be able to reuse your original job token if you applied for your AEWV before on or before 6 April 2024. Reusing an original job token means your employer can resend you the AEWV application immediately without needing to get a Job Check to hire you. You must meet all these requirements for reusing a job token: you must be working in the same role, for the same employer and in the same location you must currently be paid the same amount or more than your original AEWV depending on the date you applied you may need to meet other requirements, and your employer must be accredited. Check if an employer is accredited If you are changing your role, employer or location you cannot reuse a job token. You must use a new job token instead. Alert If you do not meet the requirements and your application is declined, you will not be able to get a refund of your visa application fee. Make sure that you and your employer understand the requirements before reusing a job token. If you applied for your AEWV between 21 June 2023 and 6 April 2024 You can reuse a job token to apply for the balance of your AEWV if: you were paid at least the February 2023 median wage when you applied for your AEWV and you are still paid at or above this rate, or your role is part of the care workforce or transport sector agreement. Sector agreements and hiring migrants on an AEWV If you applied for your AEWV on or before 20 June 2023 You can reuse a job token to apply for the balance of your AEWV if: your current AEWV is based on a role assessed at ANZSCO level 1 to 3, and you were paid at or above the median wage that was in place when you applied for your AEWV. You must continue to be paid at or above this rate. Wage rate requirements for visas If your role is ANZSCO level 4 or 5 In addition to other requirements for reusing a job token, if you have an AEWV for a job assessed at ANZSCO level 4 or 5, you can only apply with a reused job token if that role is: on the Green List included in the Care workforce sector agreement an approved Transport Work to Residence role or one that was removed on 7 April 2024, or paid at least 1.5 times the median wage that was in place when your visa was granted, and you are still paid this wage or more (this will be NZD$44.49 if your AEWV was granted after 27 February 2023, or NZD$41.64 if your visa was granted before 27 February 2023). Green List roles Sector agreements and hiring migrants on an AEWV Transport Work to Residence Visa work requirements and roles When to apply for your balance You should consider waiting until closer to when your current AEWV expires before applying. If you apply early and your situation changes, you may need to apply for a different visa or change the conditions of your current visa (variation of conditions). Changing the conditions of a work visa or applying for a Job Change You should consider if any medical or police certificates will still be valid at the time you apply. How to apply Your employer sends you a request to apply for a further AEWV with a reused job token. Receive an email of the request. You check that you meet the requirements to get your AEWV balance. You accept the request. Select the Immigration Online link in the email to start the application for a further AEWV. Note You can only accept the link once. After that, you can log in from our website to continue your AEWV application. Order we process applications with a reused job token Applications for the AEWV balance with a reused job token go into a queue. We generally process applications in the order we receive them. However, for these balance applications we generally only start processing an application when your current AEWV expiry date is within the next 9 months. In the unlikely situation that your current AEWV expires before we complete your application, you will automatically be granted an Interim Visa for up to 6 months so you can stay and continue working. If you have a partner or dependent children applying for further visas, their applications are also put in a queue. We process their applications once we decide your application. We expect a large number of people to apply for their balance of 5 years. This processing order manages demands on processing resources, while ensuring we treat visa applications fairly. Using a new job token If you applied for your first AEWV on or after 7 April 2024, or you do not meet the requirements to reuse a job token, you must use a new job token instead. This means your employer must get a new Job Check approved for your job before they can send you the link to apply for a further AEWV. Partners and children If you meet the requirements, your partner and any dependent children can also apply for a further visa to match the length of your further AEWV. They must meet the usual visa requirements and pay the fees for their applications. If you have not supported a visa for your partner or children before, you must meet the pay and skill requirements for your job to support their application. Bringing family if you have an AEWV"

        "main_content": "How to know if you are liable You can become liable for deportation if: you stay in New Zealand beyond the expiry date of your visa you breach other conditions of your visa (for example, working when you only hold a visitor visa) you are convicted for a criminal offence we find that false or misleading information had been provided, or relevant information had been withheld, in any prior application or request you submitted or in which you were included. If you do not leave New Zealand before your visa expires Note If you think we might have a reason to deport you, a licensed immigration adviser or lawyer may be able to advise you. Appealing deportation You may be able to appeal against your deportation liability, depending on your circumstances and the time the liability arose. You cannot appeal if the last visa you held was a limited visa. If you would like to appeal and are in New Zealand unlawfully, you must do so within 42 days of becoming unlawful, or within 42 days of receiving confirmation that your last visa application was declined. If you are liable for deportation for other reasons, you will normally have 28 days to appeal starting from the time you are given a deportation liability notice. Appeals are heard by the Immigration & Protection Tribunal, which is administered by the Ministry of Justice. Immigration & Protection Tribunal website What happens if you are deported If you are deported, you may not return while any prohibition period is in force and until any costs of deportation are repaid.  If you wish to return to New Zealand, you can ask to be granted a visa via a special direction, but INZ is not obligated to consider special direction requests or to give you reasons if the special direction is not granted."

You must also meet one of these three criteria: ('settled' criteria) have lived in New Zealand for the past three or more years, or ('skilled' criteria) earn at or above the median wage (NZD $27 per hour), or (‘scarce’ criteria) work in a role on a scarce list.

More information Partnership requirements Partners do not have to be in New Zealand to be included in an application. Partnership requirements for these applications are in line with current residence requirements for partners of New Zealanders. How we define a partnership You and your partner will need to be able to show you have lived together in a genuine and stable relationship for at least 12 months. INZ recognises the COVID-19 pandemic and border restrictions have meant some partners have been separated for genuine reasons. In these cases, INZ will take a pragmatic approach and consider the relationship history and how the relationship has been maintained during that time. A partner in a newly established relationship where the couple has not previously met or lived together will not be eligible as a partner under the 2021 Resident Visa. Partners outside of New Zealand granted a resident visa will be eligible to travel to New Zealand as they have a partnership-based visa with a New Zealand citizen or resident. Health and character requirements As well as meeting specific eligibility criteria, you must meet the health and character requirements for the 2021 Resident Visa. Health Health requirements for the 2021 Resident Visa will be limited but will capture medical conditions which are not eligible for medical waivers (tuberculosis, haemophilia, and conditions requiring dialysis or full-time care). If you have provided a medical certificate within the last 36 months and were assessed as having an acceptable standard of health, you will not need to provide a further medical certificate. INZ will have this information available. If your health has changed, or you were previously assessed as not having an acceptable standard of health, you must provide a new limited medical certificate. If you are applying in Phase 1 or are able to make an early application to Phase 2, you must provide a medical certificate with your application. You have until 31 July 2022 to make your application. If you are applying in Phase 2 and are not one of those able to apply early, you will be applying using our enhanced Immigration Online system. This means you will be able to apply even if you have not been able to get a medical certificate before you start your application. If a medical certificate is required, you will be asked to provide one later. If you have been able to get a medical certificate before you start, INZ will have this information and you will not need to supply another one. Immigration New Zealand may request more health information if required. If you require a new medical for your 2021 Resident Visa and will be applying for a new temporary visa prior to submitting your application you should get a general medical examination. A limited medical will not fulfil medical requirements for most temporary applications. Character INZ will undertake New Zealand Police checks for all 2021 Resident Visa applicants aged 17 years or older, regardless of how long they have been in New Zealand. An overseas police certificate may be requested if more information is required. INZ will also undertake National Security Checks (NSC) for all applicants who would normally require one as part of standard immigration processes and requirements. INZ may also request more information or verification needed as part of the process. Visa holders outside New Zealand Applicants must be in New Zealand to apply, unless they are the partner or child of a principal applicant who is in New Zealand, or they are a dependent child 25 years or older applying in their own right. The 2021 Resident Visa is designed to provide certainty for migrant workers inside New Zealand and businesses who have been playing a critical role in supporting our economy while the border remains largely closed. Those outside New Zealand who are wanting to make New Zealand home can apply for visas when the Government is able to safely reduce border restrictions. Student visa holders Student visa holders (including PhD and masters students) are not eligible for the 2021 Resident Visa. There are no plans to broaden eligibility criteria If you wish to remain in New Zealand after you complete your studies, you will need to apply for, and meet the criteria of the temporary or residence visa types available to you."

The time taken to make a decision depends on a number of factors, including how long each task takes to complete if manual assessments are required if we have to wait for information from an applicant. Those on a temporary visa close to expiring will generally be released for processing first. If your current visa is due to expire before you apply for a 2021 Resident Visa you must apply for a further temporary visa. How to apply Note Phase 2 applications will be made using the enhanced Immigration Online system.

You must have a valid passport to submit your application and you will need to provide your passport details and a photo. You will also need to provide a photo and the passport details for any family members included in your application.

Once we have received your application, we will contact you to collect any fees if required to lodge your application. Alert Do not send us credit card information by email. Visa conditions The visa conditions for the 2021 Resident Visa will be the same as other resident visa holders, including standard travel conditions. As is standard for resident visa holders, people need to apply for permanent residence to be able to travel in and out of New Zealand with no restrictions or conditions. Fees and refunds The total cost of the 2021 Resident Visa will be NZD$2,160 including GST. This includes an NZD$1,330 application fee and NZD$830 immigration levy. Immigration New Zealand operates on a cost-recovery basis and the visa application fee paid by the applicant covers the cost of Immigration New Zealand processing the application. If you have already submitted a Skilled Migrant Category Expression of Interest or Residence from Work application you will only have to pay the difference between what you have already paid and cost of the 2021 Resident Visa, provided you withdraw your previous application or EOI. If you have submitted a Skilled Migrant Category application, you will be refunded the difference if you withdraw your previous application. If you have already paid for a Skilled Migrant Category application or Expression of Interest, a Resident from Work application the process will be: You will not need to pay the fee upfront when you submit your application. You must pay the application fee once an in-principle decision has been made on your application. You must pay the application fee before the application is completed and the final decision is communicated. A fee is payable whether the application is approved or declined. You will have the option to withdraw your Skilled Migrant Category or Residence from Work application and receive a refund, which can be credited towards the 2021 Resident Visa application fee. Residence from Work applicants and people who have submitted an Expression of Interest must pay the difference between the application fees before the 2021 Resident Visa application is completed. Skilled Migrant Category applicants will be refunded the difference between the two application fees, if they agree to withdraw their onhand Skilled Migrant Category application. Only the fee part of the application cost will be required. If you have already paid a levy with a previous Skilled Migrant Category or Residence from Work application, you will not need to pay the levy again. If you do not choose to withdraw your other skilled residence application, you must pay the full application fee because we need to recover the costs of processing both the 2021 Resident Visa, and the Skilled Migrant Category/Residence from Work application. You will not need to pay another levy. Dependent children aged 25 and over applying under this category will not need to pay a separate fee or levy. The process for refunds for those who may be entitled to one is to be decided. Processing timeframes It is expected the majority of applications will be processed within 18 months, with most being processed much faster. 2021 Resident Visa processing times Note If you are applying for a 2021 Resident Visa and your current visa expires in the next 7 days, we will process a 2021 Interim Visa for you. \n 2021 Interim Visa Appeals If your application for residence is declined you will have the same appeal rights as any residence visa applicant. You will be able to appeal to the independent Immigration and Protection Tribunal. If you are not eligible for the new residence pathway you can explore other visa options if you want to stay in New Zealand permanently. If you are not eligible for the 2021 Resident Visa you may still be eligible for further temporary work visas."

You do not need to apply. We will send you an eVisa with the appropriate duration and conditions. About eVisas Alert Once you have a 2021 Interim Visa you cannot apply for other visas. If you think your 2021 Residence Visa might be declined or you may withdraw, you may want to apply for a further temporary visa instead so you can remain in New Zealand on a temporary visa. Conditions If you have a work or visitor visa the 2021 Interim Visa will let you stay in New Zealand with your current visa conditions. If you have a student visa you will get open student visa conditions, allowing you to study any programme at any educational institute at any location. How long the visa lasts The 2021 Interim Visa is valid for 12 months unless your 2021 Resident Visa application is declined or withdrawn within this 12-month period. In this case the interim visa will expire 2 months from the date of the decision to decline or withdraw. If you want to apply for a further temporary visa If your current visa is about to expire you may want to apply for a further temporary visa rather than getting a 2021 Interim Visa. You may want to do this because: the temporary visa's conditions are more suitable for you — for example, you may want to move from work to study if your 2021 Resident Visa application is declined or you withdraw, you will still have a valid, temporary visa and can apply for further visas. You must apply for further temporary visa before your current visa expires. If you have applied for both a temporary visa and a 2021 Resident Visa If you have applied for both visas and your current visa expires, you will receive an interim visa based on your temporary visa application. If you want an interim visa based on your temporary visa application, you should apply for a further temporary visa at least 7 days before your current visa expires, otherwise we may give you a 2021 Interim Visa instead.

When you apply you must tell us about current issues or activities in your past that may affect how we assess your character when we process your visa application.

Character issues you must tell us about You must tell us if you have been involved in criminal or racist activities, or if you have been removed or deported from another country. Issues preventing us from giving you a visa We can decline your application for a residence visa if you have been: convicted of an offence and were sentenced to a prison term of 5 years or more convicted in the last 10 years of an offence and were sentenced to a term in prison of 12 months or longer prohibited from entering New Zealand, or removed, excluded or deported from any country, including New Zealand.

If any of these situations apply to you, we can consider granting you a character waiver. This will depend on: what the nature of the issue is — for example, the significance of the false or misleading information provided how long ago the issue occurred the circumstances surrounding the offence or incident, or your personal circumstances, including your ties to New Zealand and whether your potential contribution to New Zealand will be significant. What to explain when you apply for a visa When you apply for a visa, provide: a full explanation of any character issues that you know about, and reasons why you would like a special direction or a character waiver. If we need more information we will contact you. False, misleading or withheld information in visa applications Character issues can delay processing your application A decision about your application for residence can be deferred for 6 months if: there is an active arrest warrant for you in any country, or your residence application is based on a relationship to a person whose New Zealand residence status is under investigation, or you are under investigation, wanted for questioning, or have been charged with an offence which, if you are convicted, would mean we would decline your application or you would need a character waiver. If the issue is not resolved within 6 months, we can delay deciding your application for longer."

Below are scams to check for and steps you can take to help protect yourself from scams or visa fraud. If you are already working in New Zealand, and think you are being exploited , do not be afraid to ask Immigration New Zealand (INZ) for help. We and Employment New Zealand can help you, and take action if needed. Migrant worker exploitation – Employment New Zealand Check for signs of a scam If you see these signs of a scam, stop and take extra precautions. Ask questions and seek official advice. You can talk to us about your concerns. Contact us You are asked to pay for your job Watch out if you are asked to pay fees for your job, sometimes called  'processing' or 'placement' fees. New Zealand employers cannot charge you fees for a job or make you pay any of their recruitment costs. This includes indirectly through a third party who then demands you pay them. If you are using: a recruitment agency, be wary about any high fees they want to charge you directly. Any charges from a recruitment agency should reflect the service they provide you. an immigration adviser, you will need to pay a fair price for their services. Immigration New Zealand only charges you an application fee. You may need to pay for costs when gathering evidence for your application, such as completing a medical. Getting application priority and access to immigration officers With this scam, your adviser, agent, consultant or other third party say they can use their connections to guarantee an outcome or faster decision. You are not required to use an adviser. Immigration New Zealand: will not prioritise your application because you use an adviser, and only decides applications by assessing the information it has against immigration rules. You are asked to lie It is illegal to lie in order to qualify for a job or a visa. Your adviser or other third party is breaking the law if they advise you to do this. It is a sign they may break other immigration or employment laws. It is important that the information you provide is true. Any false statements you make will affect your current and future visa applications. You are told you do not have the same minimum employment rights as a New Zealander This is not true. Everyone in New Zealand has the same minimum employment rights, including migrants. This includes the right to paid holidays and sick leave, and the right to complain about unsafe work practices. People who say you do not may be breaking immigration or employment laws. Minimum employment rights – Employment New Zealand You are offered a package deal with accommodation It is not common to have accommodation provided with a job in New Zealand. Only in some situations, like working on a farm or for an accommodation provider, does this make sense. Be wary about ‘package’ offers with a visa, job and accommodation – scammers may try to charge you excessive amounts for accommodation. You are promised residence New Zealand provides fantastic opportunities to study and work. A temporary visa will allow you to enjoy these opportunities, but there are no guarantees this will lead to residence. Scammers often overstate how likely residence is, so be aware as pathways to residence require certain skills, experience, qualifications or occupations. Promises on future earnings, house buying, or accessing government support You should decide to move here based on what you are offered, not on future promises that may not be kept. In general, you cannot buy a house or access government financial support unless you hold a residence visa. You cannot take on additional jobs to earn extra money. You are told you must use an adviser You are not required to use an adviser to apply for a visa. You can apply for a visa on your own using information on our website. If you choose to use an adviser, only use a licensed immigration adviser (LIA), a certified New Zealand lawyer, or someone else legally able to provide immigration advice. You can choose LIAs based on your language, location and budget. Immigration advice for your visa application You are not getting application updates If your adviser or third party is not giving you an update on your application, you can go to our website to find out how long it takes to process applications. If you are concerned because you are not receiving information, you can call us directly to verify the application. How long it takes to process an application You are not accessing our official online services We are aware of scam websites impersonating some of Immigration New Zealand’s online services. Use our official links to these services to make sure you are not being tricked into visiting fake websites. You can confirm this by checking the website address to ensure it includes ‘.immigration.govt.nz’ exactly. Check carefully as scam website addresses can look similar.

Evidence showing you are living together can include: joint ownership of, or home loan for, residential property a joint rental agreement or rental receipts joint utility accounts, like power or phone bills joint or individual mail sent to your shared address. For some partnership applications – such as a Partner of a New Zealander Resident Visa – evidence of living together must cover a period of 12 months prior to the application being submitted. Make sure you check the category you are applying under to see if we need this from you. You can provide us with items showing your shared address, dated every few months, to cover the full duration. These items can be addressed to you both jointly — or individually — as long as we can see that you have both been at the same address for the same period of time. Having a genuine and stable relationship Evidence of having a genuine and stable relationship needs to show that: others recognise your relationship you make decisions and plans together you spend leisure time together you parent together, if you have children. Evidence can include: marriage or civil union certificates birth certificates for any children you share joint bank accounts being used frequently joint ownership of any assets joint credit cards or hire purchase agreements of things such as home appliances any mutually agreed financial arrangements cards, letters or emails sent to you and your partner chat records and communication between you and your partner social media posts or photos of you together letters of support that recognise your partnership. How to supply this evidence The way we want to receive this evidence depends on how you are applying. Applying by paper If you apply by paper for a residence visa, we must receive originals or certified copies. You can send electronically issued documents as we regard those as originals. Applying online If you apply online, we accept scanned images — so you do not need to send us originals or certified copies. Minimum requirements You and your supporting partner must: be aged 18 or older, or have the consent of your parents or guardians if you are aged 16 or 17 have met each other before applying for a visa based on your partnership not be close relatives . Supporting partners When you apply for a visa based on your partnership with a New Zealand visa holder or New Zealand citizen, we call that person your supporting partner. Good character for supporting partners See also the requirements for supporting partners in the 'Eligible NZ supporting partner' and 'Your partner's' sections for these visas: Partner of a New Zealander Resident Visa Partner of a New Zealander Work Visa Partner of a New Zealander Visitor Visa How we assess partnership When we assess your visa application, we consider things like: how long you have been together how committed you are to a life together any children you have together, including your arrangements for their care whether other people recognise your relationship. We will also look at your living and financial arrangements, including: how long you have been living together as a couple your living arrangements whether you share common household tasks whether you support each other financially how you share financial responsibilities whether you own property together or share your property. If you have not always lived together If you and your partner have spent time living apart, you should provide information about your separation, including: the reasons you were living apart how long you were living apart how you kept in touch while you were not living together. We will use the information you provide to assess whether you and your partner have genuine and compelling reasons to have stayed apart.

Resident visas for dependent children Your child is dependent if they are: 24 and under, and single. If they are 18 or over they must not have children of their own. If they are aged 21 to 24 they must also rely on you or another adult for financial support (depending on which visa they have applied for).

Video — Tips to retain migrant workers for employers View transcript  Recruiting new staff can be a big undertaking - and it you’re recruiting them from overseas, it will take time and money to fine the skills you need. All new staff required training and support, but migrants face many additional challenges both inside and outside the workplace. Helping your new migrant staff and their families settle in to work and their new community will help them reach their full potential as your employee, faster. Be prepared The key to retaining migrant workers is to prepare for their arrival. Our checklists can help ready your workplace and prepared your existing staff to welcome your new migrant staff. Sharing your own knowledge of your local community and Kiwi culture will also be invaluable to them. Give ongoing support It can take time for new migrant staff to get used to living, working and communicating in a new country. Emotions will also change as they settle in. After their initial excitement, some new migrants and their families may begin to feel homesick or unsure about their decision to move. You can reduce this uncertainty by giving them support and some time to adjust throughout the first year or two of their settlement journey. Not only will this help them settle in, it’ll form the foundations for better staff retention, productivity and happier workers. Consider their point of view Some migrants will find New Zealand workplaces completely different from those in their home country. Some cultures place much more importance on status and rules at work than Kiwis do, or simply have different ways of doing things. Immigration New Zealand can provide support for you with practical tools, checklists and guides. And we’ve got resources for your migrant staff to help with planning their move here, and understanding New Zealand cultural and workplace differences. Remember, happy and well-settled migrant staff will make for a happier and more productive workplace. We’ve got plenty more information to help make retaining migrant staff easier, so check our website for more. Where to start If you are unsure of what things to consider, our checklist will prompt you with ways you can help your migrant employee.

Effective communication Your new employee may be used to a hierarchical workplace structure with managers who speak very directly. In New Zealand, employers often speak in a less direct manner, which can make our instructions sound like requests rather than orders. For example you might ask “would you mind fixing this?” but your migrant employee may be expecting an instruction like, “get this done” or “do this.” Our soft approach may make them unsure how important the task really is. We have developed a website where employees and employers can learn about barriers to good workplace communication. It includes brochures to download and video examples of how to communicate effectively with your new employee. WorkTalk: NZ Workplace Communication Workplace communication tips [PDF, 250Kb] Kiwi language, informality, and culture Kiwis can use a lot of informal language at work, including slang and swear words. This can make it difficult for migrants who may have learnt very formal English, and even for migrants whose first language is English. Some migrant workers can also be very offended by swearing. There are also many industry-specific terms or acronyms used in New Zealand workplaces. Help your employee learn new words by writing them down, or taking the time to explain them as they come up. It can be difficult for your new employee who is trying to adapt to communication styles in a different language and culture. For instance, in some cultures engaging in small talk and developing personal relationships with workmates is not the norm. Being aware of these differences can help you to understand the communication challenges your migrant employee may be facing. Keeping it clear More on preparing for migrant staff"

Understanding migration The settlement curve The settlement curve is an easy-to-follow outline of the six stages most new migrants go through. Understanding the curve can help both the employer and employee manage the stages as a natural part of a successful settlement. The workplace settlement model The model is a simple diagram that illustrates how the different parts of a migrant employee’s new life will fit together. You can support your employee to become a high-performing staff member. All new employees require integrating into your workplace, but new migrant employees are also trying to get to grips with integrating into New Zealand. To get the best from them, you can support their efforts to integrate into the community as well as your workplace. Building a sense of belonging for them and their family will lead to a well-settled, high-performing employee. A welcome that works View a short video that introduces how to settle an employee well. It’s an excellent resource to play to a workforce before a new migrant arrives.

        "header": "Home Employ migrants Accreditation for the AEWV How to apply for a Job Check How we calculate pay rates for the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) How we calculate pay rates for the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) At the job check we look at the proposed employment agreement and the information given in the application form to calculate the employee's hourly rate.",
        "main_content": "Calculating pay rates To determine the pay rate we calculate how much the employee will be paid an hour. At the Job Check this will be based on the proposed employment agreement and the information provided in the application form. For employment to be assessed as meeting a minimum pay threshold, the average guaranteed pay for each hour of work within a pay period, including any paid leave, must be at or above that threshold. Some employers may need to change employment agreements to provide these guarantees. Median wage comparison calculator The median wage is updated every year. Wage rate requirements for visas Hourly rate If someone is paid an hourly rate, for example NZD $29.66 an hour, we use that to calculate their pay rate. Wage for standard hours and a different rate for overtime hours If someone is paid a wage for standard hours and a different rate for any extra hours they work, such as overtime or weekend hours, we use the lowest hourly rate to calculate their pay rate. If the extra hours and pay are guaranteed they can be averaged within a pay period. Example Cynthia is paid NZD $29.66 an hour for 40 hours of work each week, and NZD $37.50 an hour for any additional hours she works, her pay rate will be calculated as NZD $29.66 an hour. This hourly rate would increase if Cynthia was guaranteed to be paid for at least 5 overtime hours each week. Salary Salary for a set number of hours If someone is paid a salary for a set number of hours each week, we divide their salary by the number of hours they work to calculate their pay rate. Example They are paid NZD $61,692.80 each year for 40 hours of work a week, the calculation is: $61,692.80 ÷ 52 weeks ÷ 40 hours each week = $29.66 an hour. Salary for a range of hours If someone is paid a salary for a range of hours each week, we divide their salary by the maximum number of hours they could work to calculate their pay rate. Example They are paid NZD $69,404.40 a year for 40 to 45 hours of work a week, the calculation is: $69,404.40 ÷ 52 weeks ÷ 45 hours each week = $29.66 an hour. Salary for hours changing each week If someone is paid a salary and their hours change each week, we use the lowest hourly rate to calculate their pay rate. Example Sam is paid NZD $99,840 a year, and usually works 52 hours each week, except for 8 weeks when he works 64 hours each week, the calculation to find his lowest hourly rate is: NZD $99,840 ÷ 52 weeks ÷ 64 hours each week = NZD $30 an hour. We may ask for evidence of the range of hours someone will work. Salary with hourly rate for overtime If someone is paid a salary with an hourly rate for additional work like overtime, we check what the hourly rate would be for their salary, what the hourly rate is for overtime, and use the lowest hourly rate (averaged within a pay period) to calculate their pay rate. Example John is paid NZD $65,250 each year for 40 hours of work a week, and NZD $37.50 per hour for overtime, then the calculation to find his lowest hourly rate is: $65,250 ÷ 52 weeks ÷ 40 hours each week = $31.37 an hour. Piece rates An employee is paid piece rates if they are paid a fixed amount for every item they produce, no matter how long it takes them to produce it. Piece rates are not included when we calculate pay rates for AEWV, unless they are guaranteed a top up to ensure a pay threshold is met. This includes all performance payments and commissions. Example An employee is paid a base rate of NZD $25 an hour with additional piece rates, we will calculate the pay as NZD $25 an hour. But if the employment agreement includes a guarantee that the pay will be topped up to NZD $29.66 in each pay period in case the employee does not earn enough piece rates to meet the median wage threshold, then we will calculate the pay as NZD $29.66 an hour. A meat worker on piece rates with a guaranteed top-up payment is paid a base rate of NZD $20 an hour, and 10c for every carcass processed (calculated on a per shift basis). The employer gives a guarantee in the employment agreement that they will pay a top-up if the employee does not process enough carcasses to earn the equivalent of NZD $29.66 an hour across the pay period. The employee works 40 hours in one week, and processes 2,600 carcasses. Total pay before top up is $1,060 ($26.50 an hour). Employer tops up pay to $1,186.40 ($29.66 an hour). Variable rates within a pay period If someone is paid different rates within a pay period, but those rates and hours are guaranteed, we will average the pay across the pay period. Example An employee is paid per fortnight and is required to work 10 8-hour shifts per fortnight. 6 of the shifts are day shifts paid at NZD $29 an hour, and 4 of the shifts are night shifts paid at NZD $32 an hour. The employee is guaranteed these hours and pay rates. The calculation is (6 x 8-hour shifts at $29/hour = $1,392) + (4 x 8-hour shifts at $32/hour = $1,024) = $2,416 per fortnight, averaged across 80 hours = $30.20 an hour. Including deductions in pay rate calculations When we calculate someone's pay rate, we include reasonable, agreed deductions, for example, for accommodation, goods and services. The pay rate calculation does not include: allowances, such as tool or uniform allowances, or bonuses, which are dependent on performance. If the employer provides accommodation as part of the employment package, and if the deduction is reasonable and agreed in writing, the cost of the accommodation is included when we calculate the pay rate.

A work visa with conditions means your partner, as the visa holder, needs to meet a set of employment rules or terms. If they are currently employed they need to ensure their employment meets the conditions for their new visa when it takes effect. If they are not employed they need to ensure any future role they are offered meets the conditions.

Video – Demonstration of INZ’s enhancements to Immigration Online (5:11) View transcript  In the enhanced Immigration Online system, people can quickly and easily apply for and manage their applications. Maria needs to apply for a visa. On the Immigration New Zealand website, she can click the ‘I want to’ options to guide her to the right smart application form. Or she can log into her Immigration Online dashboard, using her RealMe login. Maria can easily follow this link to create a RealMe account if she doesn’t have one. Her account doesn’t need to be verified so she can get started on her application straight away. Once logged in, Maria is taken to her dashboard. Maria has a unique sharing ID. She can use this to share her application with others, like a friend or family member, or a professional like an immigration adviser. Professionals like immigration advisers can use networks to share applications with others in their organisation, and collaborate on applications. Maria clicks ‘My Visas’ to start her application. These are all the applications Maria has made, including those that are in draft or submitted, and any visas issued. Maria clicks here to apply for a visa. Maria is applying for a Visitor Visa. Answering these questions before she starts her application helps her check she’s picked the right visa type and will minimise any potential delays when INZ starts processing her application. Maria is the principal applicant so these are her details. She can add her partner or children, if the visa type allows. This is the first page of the smart application form. First, Maria must complete her identity details. After that she can move around the application using the progress bar. Not all tabs, sections and fields will appear for all applicants. For example, the purpose of visit tab only appears for the principal applicant. Some appear or disappear depending on the previous responses. If Maria is working with a licensed immigration adviser or an exempt person, they will need to state they are providing immigration advice in the ‘immigration assistance’ tab. Licensed advisers will need to provide their licence number. If Maria had any help completing her application, she will need to complete a declaration form which authorises for someone to assist her. This will need to be uploaded under the ‘supporting documents’ tab. When the application is complete, including all mandatory fields, the progress bar turns dark blue. The form lets Maria know if she’s missed a mandatory field or made a mistake when she clicked submit. This means Maria can feel confident she has provided everything required. Her application will be ready for assessment and reduce the likelihood of INZ asking for further information. When Maria submits her application, she’s prompted to pay a fee and the application enters the system for processing. Once submitted, Maria can keep an eye on her application’s progress in her dashboard. She can also view a summary of her application – or of any other application she has submitted. If Maria needs to provide further information to INZ, she will receive an email telling her to log into her account. Maria can click to read the letter, which outlines what she needs to provide. She can then upload her evidence by clicking ‘respond’. Once Maria’s application has been fully assessed, she will receive an email to let her know if her visa has been approved. She can log into her dashboard and check the ‘My Visas’ section to view her issued visa. That’s the end of the application process. It gives Maria an easy to use form where she always knows where she’s at in the process. And it gives INZ assessment ready applications that are complete and correct, and should reduce the need for customers to call our contact centre."

        "main_content": "How we allocate applications We usually allocate applications for visas, employer accreditation and Job Checks by the date we receive them, from the oldest first. When we allocate an application, it means we assign it to an immigration officer to start assessing it. How long it takes to process an application In some cases you can make a request for urgent allocation, so we can allocate your application as a priority to an immigration officer. This request is called an 'escalation request'. We follow our visa escalation process to assess your request. Visa escalation process If you meet the all the criteria, you can send an email to make an escalation request. Your request goes to our visa escalation team to assess. The team will let you know if your request is accepted or not. Check if you can submit an escalation request Check if you can make a visa escalation request Note We do not consider travel bookings alone to be a reason for urgent allocation. We usually cannot accept escalation requests for applications submitted less than 5 days ago. This is to give enough time for the application to be properly entered into our system. If we have already assigned your application to an immigration officer, we cannot escalate it because it is already being assessed. Criteria for an escalation request Your escalation request must have a compelling or very important reason for your application to be allocated urgently. This includes: compelling personal and business circumstances humanitarian factors, and matters of national interest. Other requirements There are additional requirements and criteria for some applications. Check the following situations. Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) balance Applications for the AEWV balance with a reused job token go into a queue. We will generally only start processing AEWV balance applications when the current AEWV expiry date is within the next 9 months. If your application is in the queue, escalation requests for you and any partner or children are unlikely to meet the requirements for escalation, as your visas are still valid for 9 months or more. Applying for your AEWV balance Student visas Note You must include information that shows your application meets our criteria for escalation. The start date of your study alone is unlikely to meet our criteria. Escalation criteria We will consider the following when evaluating escalation requests for student visas: The time of application – did the student apply in good time (at least 6 weeks before the intended travel date) The intake or start date of the programme of study, and Any matters of national interest, significant personal or business circumstances or humanitarian factors. We are currently receiving a large number of escalation requests and not all are able to be accepted. Consider the specifics of the case before submitting an escalation request, and make sure you provide as much information as possible. Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa, Straight to Residence Visa, and Work to Residence Visa On 29 September 2023 we changed how we prioritise skilled residence applications. This affects Work to Residence, Straight to Residence and the Skilled Migrant Category Resident visas. We will allocate your application for processing before other skilled residence applications if you meet any of the following criteria. You have an occupation on the Tier 1 Green List. You are paid 3 times the median wage . You are a Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa applicant with 6 points without work experience. Read the Amendment Circular for more details. Amendment Circular 2023-35 Wage rate requirements for visas You can make an escalation request for these visa types if you meet any of these criteria. You must still meet all other criteria for an escalation request. Supporting visa applications for your partner or dependent children If you are supporting a partner or dependent child's visa application, you can only request an escalation for their visa after your visa application has been approved. You must still meet all the criteria for an escalation request. Visitor visa or Permanent Resident Visa The visa escalation team does not assess email requests for urgent allocation of a visitor visa or Permanent Resident Visa. This is because of the large number of requests we get. How to request urgent allocation for these visas depends on if you are from the Pacific or outside the Pacific. Applications from the Pacific If you are from the Pacific and need to request urgent allocation for a visitor visa or Permanent Resident Visa, contact our Pacific visa escalations email address: pacificvisaescalations@mbie.govt.nz You must still meet all other criteria for an escalation request. The countries and territories in the Pacific are: American Samoa Cook Islands Federated States of Micronesia Fiji French Polynesia Kiribati Marshall Islands Nauru New Caledonia Niue Papua New Guinea Samoa Solomon Islands Tonga Tuvalu Vanuatu Applications from outside the Pacific If you are from outside the Pacific and need to request urgent allocation for a visitor visa or Permanent Resident Visa, call the Immigration Call Centre: Contact us You must still meet all other criteria for an escalation request Make your escalation request If you meet the criteria for an escalation request, you can send your request to our escalations team. Who can make a request To make an escalation request for your application, you must be: the main applicant on the application form, or the legal representative or licensed immigration adviser for the main applicant. How to make a request Send your request to: visaescalations@mbie.govt.nz You need to include: applicant's first name and last name application number applicant's passport number applicant's date of birth applicant's INZ client number — if you know it why you need the application urgently allocated — explain why there are compelling or very important personal circumstances, humanitarian factors, or matters of national interest documents of evidence supporting your request. We assess your escalation request When we assess escalation requests, we check that there are: compelling or very important personal circumstances humanitarian factors, or matters of national interest. We look at: the information in the request including any supporting documents, and the circumstances of the application. We let you know if your request is accepted or declined The visa escalation team will email you to let you know if your request is accepted or not. This normally takes 2 to 5 working days. If we accept your request, we will let you know in the email when we are likely to start assessing your application. You can check your visa application status at any time. Checking your visa application status We escalate your application If we accept your request, we allocate your application as a priority to an immigration officer. Note If we accept your escalation request, it does not mean we will also approve your application. It also does not mean the time we need to assess your application will be shorter. We assess all applications using our normal processes, criteria and times.

        "main_content": "21 August 2024 4 minute read New Zealand has announced 5 tranches of support to the humanitarian response, totalling NZ$22 million, to address urgent humanitarian needs in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict. This includes contributions of: NZ$10.5 million to the World Food Programme (WFP) NZ$5 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) $4.5 million to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and $2 million to the United Nations 2720 Mechanism for Gaza. New Zealand is supporting the humanitarian efforts of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Food Programme to address the urgent humanitarian needs in Gaza. Information on New Zealand’s response to the Israel and Hamas conflict can be found on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's website. Israel-Hamas Conflict — Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Where New Zealand has previously created new visa pathways for certain conflicts these have been in response to specific and different circumstances. Afghanistan was a situation where unique circumstances required a targeted approach as Afghan nationals were at risk of harm due to their previous work and connections with the New Zealand Defence Force and other agencies in Afghanistan. Ukraine was an unusual situation given the fact that the UNHCR was unable to refer people from Ukraine to New Zealand through INZ’s refugee quota, which meant there were limited pathways for Ukrainian refugees. Decisions on changes to immigration policy settings are decided by the Government. Immigration New Zealand (INZ) response INZ understands the difficult situation this crisis is causing for many and has great sympathy for those separated from their loved ones during this stressful time. The primary way New Zealand provides support for international refugee situations is through the Refugee Quota, with an annual quota of 1500 people per annum. Refugees accepted through the Refugee Quota are referred to INZ by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Since the conflict between Israel and Hamas started, INZ has put in place processes to ensure consistency and priority allocation for any applications received for people living in these locations. These processes include: Processing all visitor visa general applications from Palestinian and Israeli passport holders in the same office. Setting up a dedicated INZ mailbox for applicants to use to request prioritisation of applications. The New Zealand Embassy in Cairo providing consular assistance for New Zealand citizens and residents attempting to leave Gaza and travel to New Zealand. So far, 26 New Zealand citizens and permanent residents have been assisted to leave Gaza. Note Only Palestinians who are also citizens of a third country, and their immediate family members (dependent children and partners), are currently being granted exit permits to leave Gaza. The New Zealand Embassy in Cairo continues to petition the Israeli and Egyptian governments for valid New Zealand visa holders to be permitted to leave Gaza. INZ will continue to prioritise and process applications for people impacted by the conflict. INZ’s response as at 21 August 2024 Since 7 October 2023, INZ has received: 648 applications from Israeli nationals across both temporary and residence visa applications. Of those received, 535 have been approved, 19 declined and the remainder are either in progress or have been withdrawn. 155 applications from Palestinian passport holders across both temporary and residence visa applications. Of those received, 98 have been approved, 32 declined and the remainder are either in progress or have been withdrawn. Of the approved applications 150 Israeli nationals and 28 Palestinians have arrived onshore. These include all visa types. Note Israel is a visa waiver country. People visiting New Zealand from Israel for a temporary stay require an NZeTA but do not need to apply for a Visitor Visa.

        "main_content": "16 August 2024 5 minute read Alert Some of the statistics below are being manually collated while we update our systems. These statistics will be updated fortnightly. The AEWV is the main temporary work visa in New Zealand. It is designed to ensure New Zealanders are first in line for jobs and makes it easier for employers to hire skilled migrants where genuine skill or labour shortages exist. It also helps combat migrant exploitation by ensuring only employers who are accredited can hire migrant workers. All applications are made through Immigration Online. Key information and statistics Accreditation applications opened on 23 May 2022, Job Check applications opened on 20 June 2022 and work visa applications opened on 4 July 2022. As at 13 August 2024 Immigration New Zealand (INZ) has approved 124,974 AEWV applications since the scheme opened, and there are currently 31,689 accredited employers and 84,676 AEWV holders. On 7 April 2024, changes were announced to the Accredited Employer Work Visa scheme. These include: Introducing an English language requirement for migrants applying for low skilled ANZSCO level 4 and 5 roles. A minimum skills and work experience threshold for most AEWV roles. For roles that fall into the ANZSCO level 4 and 5, employers will need to engage with Work and Income before approval to bring in migrants will be granted. Reducing the maximum continuous stay for most ANZSCO level 4 and 5 roles from 5 years to 3 years. Disestablishing the franchisee accreditation category and for these businesses to apply to bring in workers from overseas through the standard, high-volume, or triangular employment accreditation. Changes to the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) Accreditation process Before employers can invite a worker to apply for an AEWV they must apply to us for employer accreditation, advertise the role if they need to, and apply for a Job Check. Under the AEWV there are a range of verification steps at the application process through the accreditation, Job Check and work visa steps, as well as post-accreditation checks. We constantly review and adjust our settings to ensure they are fit for purpose and strike the right balance between bringing in the migrants that New Zealand needs and protecting the integrity of the immigration system. The accreditation process Post-accreditation checks Post-accreditation checks can occur at any time. We aim to check about 16% of accredited employers each year. As part of the application process, employers are advised there may be follow-up checks to ensure the undertakings and declarations they make during the application are correct and they are a good employer. Meeting your AEWV accredited employer obligations The 16% of post-accreditation checks we undertake are made up from a combination of: random selection targeted checks on a sample of all accredited employer types all controlling third party business models any businesses that have been referred to us through a complaint or issue raised. Post-accreditation checks are a routine process introduced as part of the scheme. They are not related to investigations into employers of potential concern involving migrant workers holding an AEWV. We expect employers to take their responsibilities seriously and comply with AEWV conditions, and there are penalties for employers who do not comply with employment or immigration laws. As at 12 August 2024 INZ has undertaken 4,352 post-accreditation checks on 3,149 employers. An additional 333 are underway. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has received 3,863 complaints against accredited employers. This number only indicates an allegation involving an accredited employer has been received, not whether the allegation can be substantiated. There are currently 286 active investigations on 278 accredited employers underway (as some are duplicates). 435 employers have had their accreditation revoked and 84 have had their accreditation suspended. 38 employers are under assessment to have their accreditation revoked and there are no employers under assessment to have their accreditation suspended. Revocations and suspensions can occur due to a range of reasons, and a number are due to liquidation. Revoking and suspending employer accreditation Revocations and suspensions can occur due to a range of reasons, and a number are due to liquidation. Employers being actively investigated for any breach of accreditation may have their accreditation suspended. Suspending an employer’s accreditation minimises immigration harm where there are reasonable concerns that an employer is not complying with the relevant immigration, employment or business standards. We can revoke an employer’s accreditation if breaches of accreditation standards are found. There is a due process followed when considering whether to suspend or revoke an employer’s accreditation. The cases are assessed individually, with all related business areas across MBIE, including INZ, working together. The vast majority of employers are doing the right thing and treat their migrant workers fairly and well. They are relying on much-needed workers from overseas to fill positions that have been hard to fill within the domestic market. MBIE — of which INZ is a part — actively monitors employers and will take action where there are concerns. Immigration law for employers Note Post-accreditation checks are separate to getting re-accreditation. Job Change process AEWV holders can apply to vary their employer, job, location, under the Job Change application process. This allows AEWV migrants greater certainty, including if they lose their job. Changing the conditions of a work visa or applying for a Job Change Apply for a Job Change or a variation of conditions for work visa holders Independent Review into AEWV An independent review into the AEWV was announced in August 2023.

        "main_content": "All non-New Zealand citizens must hold a visa to be in New Zealand. A Visa Verification Service enquiry shows details of the visa record held by INZ for a particular visa holder. It includes information about that visa and its conditions, such as length of stay, and work and study entitlements. Users might include health care providers, financial services organisations, sponsors, licensed immigration advisers, and travel agents. Individual visa holders themselves may wish to access their own visa records directly through the Visa Verification Service. Consent A Visa Verification Service enquiry must only be performed with the consent of the visa holder. INZ will release information through the Visa Verification Service only when the user can demonstrate that they know sufficient information about the visa holder and their visa to show that it is a genuine enquiry that the visa holder has authorised. Identity assurance The Visa Verification Service does not confirm identity. A Visa Verification Service Enquiry Record confirms whether the details of a visa presented to a service provider match the details of a current visa in INZ’s electronic records. Service providers are advised to also sight a passport or other appropriate identity document to ensure that the biographic details in the identity document match the biographic details in the visa, and that the photograph in the identity document matches the person presenting this information.

Tourism and international education are big export earners for New Zealand – they’re worth more than NZ $12 billion a year. The government aims to double this by 2025. Working with industry partners to facilitate migration will help reach that goal. Partnering with education providers In 2013, we trialled a partnership initiative with selected education providers to speed up visa processing. The partner education providers selected individual foreign students for ‘streamlined’ processing and took responsibility to ensure each student: had enough money to live on was serious about studying chose an appropriate course met all course entry requirements, and would comply with the conditions of their visa. The partnership ran as a trial in 2014 with 25 education providers. We extended the trial in 2015. Participants needed to be: a Students Online partner rated category 1 following an evaluation by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority able to maintain a minimum 90% approval rate of student visas able to ensure that most of their students wouldn’t breach their visa conditions known to comply with immigration laws known to comply with the Code of Practice for the Pastoral Care of International Students. Partnering with licensed immigration professionals INZ surveyed immigration professionals to find out what they wanted us to do better. Although there was some support for an industry partnership, INZ will not be pursuing a more formal partnership at this time. In the meantime, we’ll continue to focus on improvements in the following areas: electronic lodgement guaranteed processing times clearly explaining application lodgement criteria. Partnering with specific industries to streamline visa processing Entertainment industry INZ has an accreditation option for entertainment industry employers. Accreditation allows entertainment industry companies to employ migrant workers without the need to seek case-by-case agreement with the relevant union, guild, or professional association. Entertainment industry accreditation INZ also maintains a list of approved arts or musical festivals and a list of approved music promoters. Performers and direct support staff attending approved festivals, or part of an act promoted by an approved promoter, can attend as visitors and don’t need to apply for a work visa. Arts festival and music promoters Tourism industry We work in partnership with the tourism industry to attract high-value visitors who will benefit New Zealand’s economy. We discuss the state of tourism and its future so we can plan together to cope with expansion. We also work with a number of tourism industry partners to streamline visa processing for some categories of visitors.

Green List roles and requirements You do not need to engage with Work and Income if the Australia and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) code that best matches the job you are offering is skill level 1, 2 or 3. You will still need to advertise, unless your job is exempt. Find out how to find a job's ANZSCO code and skill level. Check the ANZSCO list Advertise the job Before you apply for a Job Check, you must have advertised the job in a way that will attract suitable New Zealanders. You must advertise the job on a general, national job listing website, for example Seek or TradeMe. You can advertise in other places if they are more likely to attract suitable New Zealanders. For example, you can list the job on an industry specific website like VetJobs, Engineering New Zealand or Farm Source Jobs. You must apply for a Job Check within 90 days of your job listing closing. The listing must have closed before you apply for a Job Check. How long you need to advertise for If the job is ANZSCO skill level 1, 2 or 3, you must advertise for at least 14 days. If the role is ANZSCO skill level 4 or 5, you must advertise for at least 21 days. You will also need to show that you engaged with Work and Income about the vacancy.

You may need to use 2 accounts while we move applications to the enhanced system. You will continue to have access to documents in both accounts. Sharing in the existing Immigration Online system In the existing Immigration Online sharing groups are called firms. To share applications with your firm, you first need to inform Immigration Online that you are using your account to assist clients. You can do this when you first create an account, or editing your profile by ticking the box next to the text ‘I would like to use this account to manage client applications made by my firm’. Once your account is set up, you will be able to create firms as required. These may be made to suit applications of a common type or purpose. Choose a suitable name when creating a firm. The creator of the firm will initially be assigned as the administrator, who can manage the firm. Administrators can invite and remove other users from the firm, and also provide other members with admin permissions. Sharing in the enhanced Immigration Online system In the enhanced Immigration Online system, organisations who work with applicants can create ‘networks’ of people to work on their clients’ applications. Creating networks using the updated sharing functionality LIAs and other users can still create networks to work collaboratively on visa applications. To do this, each user must have an account in the enhanced Immigration Online system. An administrator will ask for the sharing IDs and emails of each person they wish to add to the network. The administrator can assign administration rights to other members of the network. Only administrators can add or remove people from the network. Once the network is established, any member of the network can share an application they are working on to the others in the network. Members of the network can work on the application collaboratively, and will have the ability to view, edit, withdraw, submit or share the application (including outside of the network), and view any notifications related to the application. Note If you are unable to use the ‘remove’ access function, you can call our Customer Service Centre who can stop sharing an application on your behalf. You can also request a call back.

        "main_content": "If you have an Accredited Employer Work Visa, you may be able to support: a work visa for your partner a visitor visa for your partner or your children a student visa for your children. The type of visa you can support for your partner and dependent child will depend on: if your job is on the Green List and if you meet the Green List requirements how much you earn, and the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) skill level of your occupation. \n Check the ANZSCO list If you supported a visa for your family before 26 June 2024, your job does not need to meet the ANZSCO skill level requirements. Go to the section 'If you supported your family to apply for a visa before 26 June 2024' for information about the types of visas you can support. Supporting a work visa for your partner If you can support a work visa for your partner, it will either be: an open work visa, or a work visa with conditions. An open work visa means your partner can work for any employer with no pay requirements. A work visa with conditions means your partner, as the visa holder, must meet a set of employment rules or terms. For the full list of employment rules and terms, go to the 'Work' section under Conditions: \n Partner of a Worker Work Visa Visas you can support Tip If more than one scenario applies to you and your job, use the one that is most favourable. For example, if you work in an ANZSCO level 5 job that is on the Green List and you meet the Green List requirements, check 'Your job is on the Green List'. Your job is on the Green List If your role is on the Green List and you meet the role requirements, you can support: a Partner of a Worker Work Visa with open work conditions a Partner of a Worker Visitor Visa a Dependent Child Student Visa a Child of Worker Visitor Visa. Green list roles Example Yousuf holds an AEWV as a Slaughterer (ANZSCO skill level 4) and he meets the Green List requirements for the Halal Slaughterer role. He can support his partner to apply for a Partner of a Worker Work Visa. His partner's visa will have open work conditions. You earn at least NZD$59.32 an hour If you earn at least twice the February 2023 median wage (currently NZD$29.66 an hour), you can support: a Partner of a Worker Work Visa with open work conditions a Partner of a Worker Visitor Visa a Dependent Child Student Visa a Child of Worker Visitor Visa. Example Charlotte has an AEWV as a Shot Firer (ANZSCO skill level 4) and earns NZD$61.60 an hour. Because she earns at least twice the February 2023 median wage, she can support her partner to apply for a Partner of Worker Work Visa. Their visa will have open work conditions. Your job is on the transport sector agreement If your job is on the transport sector agreement and you meet the role requirements you may be able to support a visa for your family. Transport Work to Residence work requirements and roles If you earn less than NZD$29.66 an hour, you can support a Partner of a Worker Visitor Visa. If you earn at least NZD$43,322.76 a year, you can support: a Dependent Child Student Visa a Child of Worker Visitor Visa. If you earn at least NZD$29.66 an hour, you can also support a Partner of a Worker Work Visa with work conditions. Example Ranjit was granted an AEWV as a bus driver in February 2024. He earns NZD$28 an hour and meets the transport sector role requirements. Ranjit did not support a visa for his wife when he applied for his AEWV, so he can only support a Partner of a Worker Visitor Visa for his wife. On 1 October, Ranjit gets a pay rise and is now earning NZD$29.66 an hour. His wife can apply for a Partner of a Worker Work Visa. Her visa will have work conditions. Your job is on the care workforce sector agreement You may be able to support a visa for your family if your role is on the care workforce sector agreement list. You must meet the role's requirements, including any income requirements. Care Workforce Work to Residence Visa work requirements and roles ANZSCO skill level 1, 2 or 3 If you earn less than NZD$29.66 an hour, you can support: a Partner of a Worker Visitor Visa a Dependent Child Student Visa a Child of Worker Visitor Visa. If you earn at least NZD$29.66 an hour you can support a Partner of a Worker Work Visa with work conditions. ANZSCO skill level 4 or 5 If you earn at least NZD$28.25 an hour, you can support: a Partner of a Worker Visitor Visa a Dependent Child Student Visa a Child of Worker Visitor Visa. If you earn less than NZD$28.25 an hour, you cannot support a visa for your family. If you earn at least NZD$29.66 an hour you can also support a Partner of a Worker Work Visa with conditions. Your job is ANZSCO skill level 1, 2 or 3 You earn between NZD$29.66 an hour and NZD$59.31 an hour You can support: a Partner of a Worker Work Visa with work conditions a Partner of a Worker Visitor Visa a Dependent Child Student Visa a Child of Worker Visitor Visa. You earn less than NZD$29.66 an hour You may be able to support a Partner of a Worker Visitor Visa. To support a visa for your dependent child, you must earn at least NZD$43,322.76 a year. You can support: a Dependent Child Student Visa a Child of Worker Visitor Visa. Your role is ANZSCO skill level 4 or 5 Most people with an ANZSCO skill level 4 or 5 role will not be eligible to support a visa for their partner or dependent children. If you have an ANZSCO skill level 4 or 5 role, to support a visa for your family you must meet one of the following requirements: earn at least NZD$47.41 an hour work in a role that is on the Green List and meet the role's requirements work in a role that is on the transport or care workforce sector agreement and meet the role's requirements for residence, or have already supported a visa for your family before 26 June 2024. We use the occupation listed on your visa to determine your skill level. If your job has changed or you qualify for a higher skill level, you will need to apply for a Job Change before you can support a visa for partner or child. For example, if you are a Cook (skill level 4) and become a Chef (skill level 2), you must be granted a Job Change to change the occupation on your visa. Changing the conditions of a work visa or applying for a Job Change Example Riz has an AEWV and works as a Scaffolder (ANZSCO skill level 4). He earns NZD$36.60 an hour. He did not support a visa for his partner before 26 June 2024. Because he works in an ANZSCO skill level 4 job and earns less than NZD$47.41 an hour, he cannot support a visa for his partner or child. You earn at least NZD$47.41 an hour If you earn at least 1.5 times the median wage (currently NZD$31.61 an hour), you can support: a Partner of a Worker Work Visa with work conditions a Partner of a Worker Visitor Visa a Dependent Child Student Visa a Child of Worker Visitor Visa. This rate is the wage rate requirement for the Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa. \n Wage rate requirements for visas If you supported your family to apply for a visa before 26 June 2024 You can continue to support a visa for your partner or dependent child if they applied for their visa before 26 June 2024. This includes if: they already had a visa based on their relationship to you they had a work, visitor or student visa application in progress based on their relationship to you and their visa was approved after 26 June 2024 your role is ANZSCO skill level 4 or 5 and you earn less than NZD$47.41 an hour your AEWV application had not been approved yet. You must earn at least: NZD$29.66 an hour to support a Partner of a Worker Work Visa with conditions for your partner NZD$43,322.76 a year to support a Child of a Worker Visitor Visa or a Dependent Child Student Visa for your dependent children. If you earn less than NZD$29.66 an hour, you can support a Partner of a Worker Visitor Visa. You could support a work visa with open conditions if you earned at least NZD$59.32 an hour or your job was on the Green List and you met the role's requirements. Examples Siobhan has an AEWV as a Transport Conductor (ANZSCO skill level 5). She earns NZD$35 an hour and supported a Partner of a Worker Work Visa with conditions for her partner in March 2024. She can continue to support her partner's visa. Lou had an Essential Skills Work Visa as a Cook (ANZSCO skill level 4) and earns NZD$29.66 an hour. He has supported visas for his partner and child since August 2022. Lou applies for an AEWV on 1 July 2024. He can continue to support a Partner of a Worker Work Visa for his partner and a Dependent Child Student Visa for his child. Simon was granted a Post Study Work Visa (PSWV) on 27 July 2021. Since 2021, he has been supporting: a Partner of a Worker Work Visa with open conditions for his partner, and a Dependent Child Student Visa for his son. Simon works as an Grader Operator (ANZSCO skill level 4) earning NZD$32.33 an hour. His PSWV is ending so he applies for and is granted an AEWV on 4 July 2024. Simon can continue to support visas for his partner and child. His partner's new work visa will have conditions because Simon does not earn at least NZD$59.32 an hour or work in a job on the Green List. If your income changes or your job is added to the Green List You may be able to support a visa for your partner or dependent child if: you get a pay rise and you now earn the income requirement for your job and ANZSCO level, or your job is added to the Green List and you meet the Green List role requirements. Your partner can apply to change their work conditions to an open work visa if: you start to earn at least NZD$59.32 an hour, or your job is added to the Green List and you meet all the role's requirements. Changing the conditions of a work visa or applying for a Job Change Pay rise or Green List evidence your partner needs for their application Pay rise evidence your partner needs for their application are your: employment agreement or a letter from your employer confirming the pay and hours, and full bank statements showing a salary payment, a summary of income details from Inland Revenue or pay slips. Green List evidence must show that you meet the Green List requirements. These are set out for each role in the Green List. Green List roles Example Lotta was granted an AEWV as a personal care worker (ANZSCO skill level 4) on 1 June 2024. She had not previously supported a visa for her partner and child. She earns NZD$26.16 an hour and she cannot support a visa for her family. On 15 August 2024, Lotta gets a pay rise and now earns NZD$28.25 an hour. She can support a Partner of a Worker Visitor Visa for her husband and a Child of a Worker Visitor Visa for her daughter. If Lotta gets another pay rise and starts to earn more than NZD$29.66 an hour, her husband can apply for a Partner of a Worker Work Visa. His visa will have work conditions."

        "main_content": "Who can sponsor you You can be sponsored for the Parent Resident Visa by: your adult New Zealand citizen or resident child jointly by your adult child and their partner, or jointly by your adult child and another adult child of a parent included in the application. Your sponsors need to be New Zealand citizens or residents who have been resident here for at least 3 years. If you are being sponsored by a child and their partner, they must have been living together for at least 12 months. Your sponsors must earn enough They must have earned at least the minimum income we require for 2 years in the 3-year period before your expression of interest was selected. The minimum income they need changes depending on if you have single or joint sponsors. To calculate your sponsor or sponsor's minimum income You need to know: if you have 1 or 2 sponsors how many parents are being sponsored — this includes any parents they are also currently sponsoring which two 12-month periods your sponsor will use to have their income assessed on what the New Zealand median income was on the last day of each 12-month period that your sponsor’s income will be assessed on. You can use the minimum income tables to check the New Zealand median wage for the past 3 years and how much your sponsors need to have earned. Minimum income table: for 1 sponsor This starts at 1.5 times the New Zealand median wage for 1 parent, and increases by half the median wage amount for each additional parent. Table 1: Minimum income for 1 sponsor Effective date Median wage 1 parent 2 parents 3 parents 4 parents From 28 February 2024 NZD$65,748.80 NZD$98,623.20 NZD$131,497.60 NZD$164,372 NZD$197,246.40 May 2023 to 27 February 2024 NZD$61,692.80 NZD$92,539.20 NZD$123,385.60 NZD$154,232 NZD$185,078.40 January 2022 to April 2023 NZD$57,740 NZD$86,611.20 NZD$115,481.60 NZD$144,352 NZD$173,222.40 January 2021 to December 2021 NZD$56,160 NZD$84,240 NZD$112,320 NZD$140,400 NZD$168,480 January 2020 to December 2020 NZD$53,040 NZD$79,560 NZD$106,080 NZD$132,600 NZD$159,120 Minimum income table: for 2 sponsors This starts at 2 times the median wage for 1 parent, and increases by half the median wage amount for each additional parent.

Claire and Diana have agreed to jointly sponsor them. Ann and Brian have their expression of interest selected on the 24 November 2022 and are invited to apply for residence on the same day. This means the 3-year period where we can assess Claire and Diana's income goes from 25 November 2019 to 24 November 2022. Claire and Diana must choose two 12-month periods in the 3-year period where they show they can meet the income threshold. As they are joint sponsors, they must use the same 12-month periods. Diana was on parental leave from June 2019 to June 2020 so her income was lower during that 12 months. The sisters decide to use these two 12-month periods to show they meet the income threshold: August 2020 to July 2021 August 2021 to July 2022. Claire and Diana check the minimum income tables for 2 sponsors and look at the column for 2 parents, since that is how many people each of them are sponsoring, then check the amount needed in each year. The first period ends in 2021, so they need to show that the total of both their income over that time was NZD $140,400. The second period ends in 2022, so they need to show that the total of both their incomes over that time was NZD $144,352. How the minimum sponsor income is calculated The amount a sponsor needs to earn to sponsor one parent is: 1.5 times the current New Zealand median wage for a single sponsor 2 times the current New Zealand median wage for joint sponsors. The minimum income increases by half the New Zealand median wage for each additional parent, up to a maximum of 6 parents. NOTE We update the New Zealand median wage each year, so the amount they need to earn will change depending on which years they include with your application. Wage rate requirements for visas We only consider taxable income For us to count your sponsor's income it must be taxable and appear on their Inland Revenue summary of income or Final Tax Summary. Request a summary of income — Inland Revenue If your sponsor has already sponsored a parent If your sponsor has already sponsored 1 parent or more, we include that parent in their minimum income calculation. For example, if your adult child previously sponsored 2 parents then they and their partner sponsored 2 more parents after it reopens, they will need to meet the income requirements to sponsor 4 parents. Note If your sponsor's income helped to sponsor their partner's parents in an application made before 2017 they are not considered a previous sponsor. Parent Resident Visa"

Learn more about what these changes mean for RSE employers and workers.",
        "main_content": "Overview and background The Government are making changes to the RSE for the 2024/25 season that can be delivered quickly to support the growth of New Zealand’s horticulture and viticulture industries. These changes will help reduce costs and compliance needs for employers. They will also benefit RSE workers. They are initial changes in response to the policy review work carried out in 2023. These changes will take effect from 2 September 2024. Work will begin on further changes to the RSE scheme later in 2024. Changes for RSE employers RSE cap The RSE cap will increase to 20,750 for 2024/2025. This is an increase of 1,250 workers. If you requested an increase in the May 2024 RSE employer allocation survey, an RSE engagement partner will contact you with further information about this change. 30-hour minimum weekly work requirement Employers will be able to average out the 30-hour minimum weekly work requirement over 4 weeks. RSE workers must currently be paid a minimum of 30 hours per week. Employers have raised concerns that factors like weather can cause weekly fluctuations in the availability of work, meaning they may pay for hours which are not worked under current rules. This change will mean employers (including joint ATR employers) will be able to average out the 30-hour requirement across a 4-week period. If an employer cannot provide the required 120 hours of work over the 4-week period, they will need to top up the worker’s pay to meet this amount. RSE Wage requirements Employers will need to pay RSE workers at least NZD$25.47 (10 percent above the minimum wage) if they are returning for their third and subsequent seasons. All other workers will need to be paid, at least the New Zealand minimum wage . Accommodation costs The pause on accommodation cost increases will be lifted and employers will be able to apply a temporary increase. Employers will be able to increase weekly accommodation costs (covering both rent and utilities) for RSE workers by either 15 percent or NZD$15.00, whichever is less, for 12 months. Accommodation deductions must still be for actual, reasonable, and verifiable expenses. This only applies to workers who have not already signed agreements about the costs of accommodation before 2 September 2024. This is because once agreed, the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 does not allow rent increases within 12 months. MBIE will work with stakeholders over the longer term to develop a more permanent, comprehensive method of determining accommodation costs. Moving between employers or regions The flexibility for RSE workers to move between employers and regions will be increased as part of these changes. The current grace period for the movement of workers will be extended from 14 to 21 days either side of the worker’s move date, as approved on the ATR. This increased flexibility applies to both joint ATRs and individual employers with multiple worksites, where movement between the worksites has been approved on the ATR. Further opportunities to increase flexibility in the longer-term will be considered as part of the next phase of work to review the RSE scheme. This will include the approach to labour market testing to ensure that the ‘New Zealanders first’ principle of the RSE scheme is not undermined, worker welfare is protected and a graduated enforcement model introduced. Inclusion of Timor-Leste Timor-Leste will be added to the RSE scheme in the future. Further work is needed over the next year to set up the systems and infrastructure so that Timor-Leste can participate in the scheme and worker recruitment can start. Employers cannot hire RSE workers from Timor-Leste yet. We will advise employers when recruitment arrangements can be commenced. Changes for RSE workers RSE workers eligible for multi-entry visas RSE workers will be able to leave and return to New Zealand during a season, as RSE workers will be eligible for a multi-entry visa . This will allow them to attend events at home such as funerals, without needing to apply for another visa. RSE Workers will be expected to cover the costs of temporary departures from New Zealand, including flights. Training and skill development Currently RSE workers can only do training directly relevant to their role, and only through industry training organisations. As part of these changes, RSE workers may be able to study, train and develop skills, even if it is not directly related to their role. Training will also not have to take place through industry training organisations. RSE workers must continue to meet the requirements of their employment agreement while taking part in any study or training. HIV screening requirements RSE workers will no longer need to be screened for HIV. HIV was removed from the list of medical conditions likely to impose significant costs and demands on New Zealand’s health services in 2021. This change brings the RSE visa into line with other visas. Next steps for RSE employers What you need to do as an RSE employer in response to these changes may be different, depending on where you are in the ATR process. Stage Date submitted What policy applies What action to take ATR Submitted or approved before 2 September 2024 The existing policy applies. If you have not offered the employment agreement submitted with your ATR to workers and you wish to update it in line with the new policy, you can submit a 'Variation of Agreement to Recruit' form to the RSE Unit for approval. The form will only allow you to update: Minimum remuneration Average hours Accommodation cost deduction To use the new policy, we will provide a 'Variation of Agreement to Recruit' form. You will need to: 1. Submit this form to the RSE Unit via email, with the subject line “Variation of Agreement to Recruit” to RSEUnit@mbie.govt.nz. 2. The RSE Unit will then consider and decide your request, in the order received. 3. If the Variation of Agreement to Recruit is approved, you can offer an updated employment agreement to workers. Decisions on variations of agreements to recruit will be made from 2 September 2024. N/A Submitted on or after 2 September 2024 The new policy applies.

RSE Limited Visa Submitted or approved before 2 September 2024 The existing policy applies. You must honour existing employment agreements for 2024/25. No changes are permitted, from the employment agreement approved in your ATR, unless they are more beneficial to workers. RSE Limited Visa Submitted on or after 2 September 2024 Employment contract not yet offered to workers. New policy: You can offer employment agreements in line with your ATR under the new policy, provided you have approval from the RSE Unit. However, if you have already offered an employment agreement using the old policy to the worker, you must honour the employment agreement terms and conditions. Variation of Agreement to Recruit Variation of Agreement to Recruit (INZ 1388) PDF 382KB Tips to avoid processing delays for your ATR Use the correct application form. If you use an incorrect application form this will delay your application. Self-audit all your intended accommodation every 12 months. Ensure all accommodation documentation is sent directly to the Labour Inspectorate at LIRSEemployerqueries@mbie.govt.nz before your ATR is submitted. Ensure that deduction consent forms are specific to the group of workers and clear and concise with specific amounts and weekly instalments. Note ATR applications will be decided in the order received, and are not prioritised based on worker arrival dates. Tips to avoid processing delays for RSE Limited Work Visas Use the correct application form. If you use an incorrect application form this will delay your application. Allow at least 5 working days for RSE Limited Work Visas to be processed, from the date we receive the application. Include all relevant information with your application form. The updated RSE Limited Work Visa form will have a new question to clarify how many RSE seasons you have spent in New Zealand. This is so we can confirm if you are eligible for a higher hourly pay rate. Note RSE Limited Work Visa applications will be decided in the order received, and are not prioritised based on flight dates. If you have further questions If you have any further questions about these changes you can contact your RSE Engagement Partner, or contact our Customer Service Centre. Contact us"

This is part of our efforts to improve processing times, particularly for Visitor Visas, and our focus on progressing outstanding Visitor Visa applications submitted in August. For Visitor Visa applicants, please only provide medical certificates if requested We have received a high number of medical certificates that INZ had not yet requested, and this has created pressure in our system. Many Visitor Visa applicants will not need to provide medical certificates, so customers can save time by waiting to see if we determine one is necessary. If you’ve been asked to provide a medical certificate, please do so If you’ve applied for a Visitor Visa (excluding Group Visitor Visas and Visitor Visa for people from Pacific Islands), a 2021 Resident Visa, or an Accredited Employer Work Visa, you can check your application status online. If we’ve asked you to provide medicals, it will be updated with ‘Waiting on you to provide medicals’ If you’ve provided the requested medical certificate, you don’t need to do anything further. Please be assured we’ve received your documentation and your visa application is still being processed. Your status will remain as ‘Waiting on you to provide medicals’ until we have checked the medicals you’ve provided. You will be contacted via immigration online if any further information is required. We apologise for the confusion this status is causing and are working to improve the information we provide customers as their application is progressed. Your status may remain as ‘waiting on you to provide medicals’ while other activities are happening In addition to checking your medical certificate, your application may also undergo third-party checks, such as checking for a New Zealand Police Certificate. The ‘waiting for medical certificate’ status will not change until all items we are waiting on have been received. We understand it can be frustrating having your application sit under the same status for some time however, your application is progressing through the various processing steps behind the scenes.

        "main_content": "Alert The application phase of the Edmund Hillary Fellowship's pilot program was completed in mid-2020. There is currently no timeline for future cohorts. Only individuals already accepted into the Fellowship can apply for these Global Impact Visas. The Global Impact Visa (GIVs) provides individual pioneering entrepreneurs and investors with a 3-year visa to create, support, and incubate ventures and models that result in positive global impact, from New Zealand. After 3 years, migrants can qualify for permanent residency. There are 2 stages to the application process: Submit an application, and be accepted into, the Edmund Hillary Fellowship (EHF) ( applications now closed ) Apply for a Global Impact Visa. Global Impact Work Visa Find out more about the Edmund Hillary Fellowship The Edmund Hillary Fellowship The Edmund Hillary Fellowship (EHF) fosters humankind's creative potential from New Zealand, by supporting a community of impact entrepreneurs, investors and changemakers to build meaningful solutions to global problems. EHF has accepted a cohort of Fellows through a rigorous application process, which is now closed. New Zealanders building innovative ventures are also part of each cohort to strengthen the community. EHF leverages New Zealand's unique platforms to test, incubate, and scale innovative ideas that can create lasting positive impact, in New Zealand and around the world. EHF operates as a not-for-profit organisation owned by the Hillary Institute of International Leadership. By partnering with local and international  experts in innovation, and leveraging private sector strengths, the New Zealand Government is better positioned to accelerate impact-based innovation and grow New Zealand for all. Meet the Fellows in the Edmund Hillary Fellowship Participation in EHF provides Fellows with: Exclusive access to New Zealand's Global Impact Visa A global network of talented entrepreneurial and investment leaders who are personally invested in helping each other succeed, offering diverse expertise, mentorship opportunities, cross-sector collaboration opportunities, and a peer-support network Connections to New Zealand's start-up ecosystem, government leaders, mentors, investors, research and development institutes and Māori communities Immersive experiences to learn Tikanga Māori, the Māori ways of doing things, and how to navigate business within a multicultural society Participation in workshops, skill-sharing sessions, learning opportunities, and retreats with other Fellows A platform to tell their story through international channels A lifelong community of passionate change makers, and an opportunity to be at the front line of leading systemic global change from New Zealand In return, Fellows are expected to contribute towards New Zealand entrepreneurship communities and actively work on, or invest in, ventures within New Zealand that have the potential for widespread global impact. Global Impact Visa (GIVs) The Global Impact Visa is a 3-year open work visa that enables participants in the Edmund Hillary Fellowship to work and live in New Zealand, with a path to permanent residence. Separate visas are also available for immediate family of Global Impact Visa holders. To be eligible to apply for permanent residence, you must remain in the Edmund Hillary Fellowship for 30 months, and maintain the support of the Edmund Hillary Fellowship. Who is GIVs for? The policy was designed to attract individuals and teams with the drive and capability to launch global impact ventures from New Zealand who may not be able to qualify for other visa categories, and investors who wish to support impactful ventures. They have the combination of relentless drive, skills, global connections, and desire to leverage the unique opportunities New Zealand offers, to build successful innovation-based ventures, and make game-changing impact on the world. The GIVs selection process EHF has been responsible for identifying individuals and teams who could have a significant impact on New Zealand’s innovation system, whilst Immigration New Zealand is responsible for processing and making decisions on visas. To be eligible for a Global Impact Visa, applicants must first be accepted into EHF. Once accepted into the Fellowship candidates can apply for a Global Impact Visa. Note The application process into the Fellowship is now closed. Eligibility for GIVs is conditional on meeting a number of criteria. Selected applicants will be assessed on the basis of their acceptance into EHF’s programme, English language, health and character, and having sufficient funds to support themselves.

Your job or job offer must be full-time. You must also be suitably qualified to do the job — your training and experience must match your occupation's ANZSCO skill level.

ANZSCO was updated in November 2019 and some occupations that were skill level 4 or 5 are now skill level 1 to 3 in the updated version. If you are paid at least NZD $29.66 an hour or above (or the equivalent as an annual salary) for one of these occupations, we will treat it as an exception and assess it as ANZSCO skill level 1, 2 or 3. We are required by legislation to assess your application using the version of ANZSCO that was valid at the time you made your application.

The Essential Skills Work Visa closed to new applications on 4 July 2022. If you have an existing visa, your individual conditions will remain until the visa expires.",
        "main_content": "Calculating your pay rate The conditions of your Essential Skills visa depend on if you are paid below the median wage or the median wage or above. To determine your pay rate, we calculated how much you are paid per hour, based on your employment agreement. To be considered above the median income, every hour you work must be paid above the NZ median wage, which was NZD $27 an hour up to 4 July 2022. Updating Essential Skills pay rate thresholds If you are paid hourly If you are paid an hourly rate, for example NZD $27 an hour, then we used that to calculate your level. If you are paid a wage for standard hours and a different rate for overtime hours If you are paid a wage for standard hours and a different rate for any extra hours you work, such as overtime or weekend hours, we used the lowest hourly rate to calculate your level. For example, if you are paid NZD $27 an hour for 40 hours of work each week, and NZD $37.50 an hour for any additional hours, then we used NZD $27 an hour to calculate your level. If you are paid a salary for a set number of hours If you are paid a salary for a set number of hours each week, we divided your salary by the number of hours you work to calculate your level. For example, if you are paid NZD $55,000 each year for 40 hours of work a week, the calculation was: $55,000 ÷ 52 weeks ÷ 40 hours each week = $26.44 an hour. If you are paid a salary for a range of hours If you are paid a salary for a range of hours each week, we divided your salary by the maximum number of hours you could work to calculate your level. For example, if you are paid NZD $55,000 an year for 40 to 45 hours of work a week, the calculation was: $55,000 ÷ 52 weeks ÷ 45 hours each week = $23.50 each hour. If you are paid a salary and your hours change each week If you are paid a salary and your hours change each week, we used the lowest hourly rate to calculate your level. For example, if you are paid NZD $54,000 a year, and usually work 52 hours each week, except for 8 weeks when you work 64 hours a week, the calculation to find your lowest hourly rate was: NZD $54,000 ÷ 52 weeks ÷ 64 hours each week = NZD $16.23 each hour. We may have asked for evidence of the range of hours you will work. NOTE This situation often applies to farm workers, who may have employment agreements that state the different hours expected during different parts of the year. If you are paid a salary with an hourly rate for overtime If you are paid a salary, with an hourly rate for additional work like overtime, we checked what the hourly rate would be for your salary, what the hourly rate is for overtime, and used the lowest hourly rate to calculate your level. For example, if you are paid NZD $55,000 each year for 40 hours of work a week, and NZD $37.50 per hour for overtime, then the calculation to find your lowest hourly rate was: $55,000 ÷ 52 weeks ÷ 40 hours each week = $26.45 each hour. Including deductions in pay rate calculations When we calculated your pay rate, we included reasonable, agreed deductions, for example, for accommodation, goods and services, if you met a particular pay rate threshold. The pay rate calculation did not include: allowances, such as tool or uniform allowances, or bonuses, which are dependent on performance. Piece rates for Essential Skills Work Visas You are paid piece rates if you are paid a fixed amount for every item you produce, no matter how long it takes you to produce it. Piece rates were not included when we calculated pay rates for Essential Skills Work Visas. If you want to get a second job If you have been granted an Essential Skills Work Visa that lets you have a second job (secondary employment), the level was determined by your main job's pay rate. For example, we determine your employment to be above the median wage if you had 2 jobs and: 1 was 40 hours a week and paid more than the median wage, and the other was 10 hours a week paid just above minimum wage. You were granted an Essential Skills Work Visa based on your main employment, which must meet the visa's conditions. Check your visa conditions If your employment package includes accommodation If your employer provides you with accommodation as part of your employment package, then deduct the cost of this from your salary. If the deduction is reasonable and you have agreed to it in writing, then the cost of the accommodation was included when we calculated your pay rate."

The time spent in New Zealand does not need to be consecutive. There is no minimum amount within a calendar year. Most people will be able to work out how long they have spent outside of New Zealand in the last 3 years, but if you need to check how much time you have spent in New Zealand, you can request your travel movements from the Customer Service Centre. Most eligible work visa holders are expected to meet the 'settled' criteria. Immigration New Zealand (INZ) will use border movement records to decide if you meet this criteria. The application form will ask about the time spent in New Zealand. You will not need to provide evidence of your 'settled' eligibility unless asked to do so by an immigration officer. ‘Skilled’ criteria If you have not been here for 3 or more years you may be eligible under the ‘skilled’ criteria. To meet the skilled criteria, you must be paid the median wage of NZD $27 per hour or more on 29 September 2021. Your job must be genuine full time work for an average of at least 30 hours per week. Pay rates will be calculated the same way as Skilled Migrant and Essential Skills applications. If you are a self-employed contractor with a consistent history of contract work and a current contract you are eligible for the 2021 Resident Visa. This is similar to the Skilled Migrant Category. Applying under the skilled criteria you will need to provide: an employment agreement or a letter from your employer confirming the pay and hours, and a full bank statement or an Inland Revenue summary of income or payslips. The documents must show you were paid at least NZD $27 each hour, both on 29 September and on the date you apply. There is some flexibility if your pay or hours are temporarily reduced due to the business being affected by COVID-19 related restrictions. More information may be requested by INZ when your application is being assessed to help confirm the requirements are met. Applicants must also meet ‘skilled’ criteria at the time they apply. They may change to meet ‘scarce’ criteria at the time of application. 'Scarce' criteria If you haven’t been here for 3 or more years and are not paid at least NZD $27 per hour, you may be eligible under the ‘scarce’ criteria.

Providing evidence of your partnership You must be able to show us that you and your partner are living together in a genuine and stable relationship before we can approve a visa application based on your partnership.

Evidence showing you are living together can include: joint ownership of, or home loan for, residential property a joint rental agreement or rental receipts joint utility accounts, like power or phone bills joint or individual mail sent to your shared address.

Last year our Enhanced Immigration Online system requested new medical certificates from applicants when it could not find their existing medical certificates. This happened for a short period and we apologised for the resulting confusion. We put a technical solution in place in July 2022. We will contact the 1,049 affected applicants we have identified and invite them to request a reimbursement. Applicants have until 23:59, 30 September 2023 New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT) to submit their request. Applicants who are requesting reimbursement must provide evidence of payment such as either a: receipt from their medical practice letter or email of confirmation from the medical practice, or copy of the bank statement showing the relevant transactions. The process to identify affected applicants was complex because enhanced Immigration Online was a new system. We needed to understand how the new system automates and integrates with old systems. We also needed to determine different scenarios where applicants were impacted in. It is possible that we may not have identified all affected applicants. We have made information about the reimbursement available for them on the website.

The Immigration New Zealand website’s the place to go for information on the visa, including an eligibility checker, so you can test whether you meet the criteria to apply. immigration.govt.nz/2021-resident-visa \n Phases and eligibilities Applications for the 2021 Resident Visa will be in two phases, with the first phase opening on the 1 of December 2021 and the second phase opening on the 1 of March 2022. You can apply in Phase 1 if you were in New Zealand and held an eligible work visa on the 29th of September 2021. You also must have submitted … a Skilled Migrant Category application a Residence from Work application or a Skilled Migrant Category Expression of Interest ….on or before the 29th of September 2021. If you don’t fall into Phase 1, you’re in Phase 2. The information in this video explains the application process for phase 1 applicants, and provides some helpful information about the application process, so you know what to expect, and need to provide with your application. There is another video on our website for phase 2 applicants. 2021 Resident Visa Phase Two Applying in Phase One First, you will need a RealMe account so you can submit your 2021 Resident Visa application online through Immigration Online. You will also need to provide your Skilled Migrant Category or Residence from Work application number, or your Skilled Migrant Category Expression of Interest reference number when you apply – note this number can only be used on one application. Remember, because you are applying under Phase one, you will not need to pay an application fee when you submit your application. Before you apply and the documents required for each criteria Before you apply, make sure you have all the documents you need to show you meet the criteria. This will make the assessment process quicker and means we won’t need to contact you to ask for more information. The documents you need to provide will depend on which criteria you are applying under. You will need to show that you meet one of the following three criteria – settled or skilled or scarce. No matter which one of the three criteria you apply under, you must have been in New Zealand on the 29 September 2021. But the documents you need to provide will be different. So, let’s take a look at what you need for each criteria. You can apply under the settled criteria if you have been in New Zealand for at least 821 days in the three years between the 29th of September 2018 and the 29 September 2021. The application form will ask you about the time you have been in New Zealand but you don’t need to provide evidence for this – we will use the information we already have to confirm you are eligible. If you apply under the skilled criteria, you will need to provide your employment agreement or a letter from your employer confirming your pay and hours. You will also need to provide a full bank statement, or an Inland Revenue summary of income or payslips. It is important that these documents show that you were paid at least NZD $27 per hour, both on the 29th September 2021 and on the date you apply. If you apply under the scarce criteria, you will also need to provide your employment agreement or a letter from your employer confirming your job and hours. You’ll also need to provide evidence of occupational registration in New Zealand if that is required for your job. The list of ‘scarce’ occupations is available on our website. immigration.govt.nz/scarce-occupations As well as the settled, skilled, or scarce criteria, everyone needs to meet the health and character requirements for the 2021 Resident Visa. Health and Character requirements For health requirements, you don’t need to provide any new medical information if you have provided us with a medical certificate within the last 36 months and you were assessed as meeting health requirements at that time. But if it has been more than 36 months, or your health has changed, you will need to provide a new limited medical certificate. You will need your medical certificate to be able to submit your application. For the character requirements, you don’t need to provide anything. We will request New Zealand Police checks for all applicants aged 17 years or older. Overseas police certificates are not required unless we ask for one. For all evidence, you only need to provide the documents asked for in the form. If we need more information, we will contact you to request this. What happen next and application costs So what happens after you submit your application? First, you will receive an acknowledgement email from us. This will tell you what to expect while we’re assessing your application and when you can expect to hear from us. Once we have received your application, it will be allocated to an immigration officer for assessment. If more information is needed, or if we need you to send us your passport, the immigration officer will contact you. If we don’t need more information, we will go ahead and process your application and you will next hear from us once a decision on your application has been made. At this point, we will contact you and we will provide details about the application fee and how you can pay. You will also have the option to withdraw your existing skilled residence application or expression of interest. The cost of the 2021 Resident Visa application is NZD $2,160 including GST. This is made up of the application fee and a NZD $830 immigration levy. If you choose to withdraw your existing skilled residence application or expression of interest, the fee you have already paid can be credited towards your 2021 Resident Visa application fee. If you need to pay the difference between the two fees, details of the amount to be paid and a link to a payment form will be sent to you. If the amount you have already paid is more than the cost of the 2021 Resident Visa, we will arrange to refund you with the difference. Your e-Visa Once any required payment has been processed, we’ll issue you with your eVisa. If you have had to provide your passport, this is when we will return this to you. Our goal is to make the 2021 Resident Visa application process as easy as possible for you and to make sure you have all the information you need. Remember, the Immigration website is the best place to go for up-to-date information including processing times and updates — so make a point to visit it regularly. immigration.govt.nz/2021-resident-visa"

নিযুক্ত করতে পারে যা তাদের দেওয়া প্রতিশ্রুতির সাথে মেলে না। যে স্ক্যামগুলি যাচাই করে দেখতে হবে এবং স্ক্যাম বা ভিসা জালিয়াতি থেকে নিজেকে রক্ষা করতে আপনি যে পদক্ষেপগুলি নিতে পারেন তা নীচে দেওয়া হল। আপনি যদি ইতিমধ্যে নিউজিল্যান্ডে কাজ করেন, এবং মনে করেন যে আপনাকে স্বার্থসিদ্ধির জন্য ব্যবহার করা হচ্ছে তাহলে ইমিগ্রেশন নিউজিল্যান্ড (INZ) এর কাছে সাহায্য চাইতে ভয় পাবেন না। আমরা এবং এমপ্লয়মেন্ট নিউজিল্যান্ড আপনাকে সাহায্য করতে পারি, এবং প্রয়োজনে পদক্ষেপ নিতে পারি। স্ক্যামের লক্ষণগুলি আছে কিনা পরীক্ষা করুন আপনি যদি কোনও স্ক্যামের এই লক্ষণগুলি দেখতে পান তবে আর এগোবেন না এবং অতিরিক্ত সতর্কতা অবলম্বন করুন। প্রশ্ন জিজ্ঞাসা করুন এবং অফিসিয়াল পরামর্শ নিন। আপনি আপনার উদ্বেগ সম্পর্কে আমাদের সাথে কথা বলতে পারেন। আপনাকে আপনার কাজের জন্য অর্থ প্রদান করতে বলা হয়েছে আপনাকে যদি আপনার কাজের জন্য ফি দিতে বলা হয়, যাকে অনেক সময় 'প্রসেসিং' বা 'প্লেসমেন্ট' ফি বলা হয় তাহলে সতর্ক থাকুন। নিউজিল্যান্ডের নিয়োগকর্তারা আপনাকে কোনও কাজের জন্য ফি চার্জ করতে পারেন না বা তাদের চাকরিতে বহাল করার কোন খরচ দিতে আপনাকে বাধ্য করতে পারেন না।এর মধ্যে পরোক্ষভাবে একটি তৃতীয় পক্ষের মাধ্যম অন্তর্ভুক্ত রয়েছে যারা তারপর তাদের অর্থ প্রদান করার জন্য আপনার কাছে দাবি করে। আপনি যদি: একটি নিয়োগ সংস্থা ব্যবহার করেন, তাহলে তারা আপনাকে কোনও বেশি ফি সরাসরি চার্জ করতে চাইলে সে সম্পর্কে সতর্ক থাকুন। কোনও নিয়োগ সংস্থা থেকে যে কোনও চার্জে তারা আপনাকে যে পরিষেবা দেয় তা প্রতিফলিত হওয়া উচিত। একজন ইমিগ্রেশন উপদেষ্টা ব্যবহার করেন, তাহলে আপনাকে তাদের পরিষেবাগুলির জন্য ন্যায্য মূল্য দিতে হবে। ইমিগ্রেশন নিউজিল্যান্ড শুধুমাত্র আপনাকে একটি আবেদন ফি চার্জ করে। আপনার আবেদনের জন্য প্রমাণ সংগ্রহ করার সময় যে খরচ হবে তার জন্য আপনাকে অর্থ প্রদান করতে হতে পারে, যেমন একটি মেডিকেল সম্পূর্ণ করা। আবেদনের অগ্রাধিকার এবং ইমিগ্রেশন কর্মকর্তাদের অ্যাক্সেস পাওয়া এই স্ক্যামে, আপনার উপদেষ্টা, এজেন্ট, পরামর্শদাতা বা অন্যান্য তৃতীয় পক্ষ বলে যে তারা ফলাফল বা দ্রুত সিদ্ধান্ত নিশ্চিত করার জন্য তাদের সংযোগগুলি ব্যবহার করতে পারে। আপনাকে উপদেষ্টা ব্যবহার করতে হবে না। ইমিগ্রেশন নিউজিল্যান্ড: আপনি একজন উপদেষ্টা ব্যবহার করেন বলে আপনার আবেদনকে অগ্রাধিকার দেবে না, এবং শুধুমাত্র ইমিগ্রেশন নিয়মের পরিপ্রেক্ষিতে তথ্য মূল্যায়ন করে আবেদনগুলির সিদ্ধান্ত নেয়। আবেদনের অগ্রাধিকার এবং ইমিগ্রেশন কর্মকর্তাদের অ্যাক্সেস পাওয়া এই স্ক্যামে,

না। আপনি যদি এটা করেন তাহলে ইমিগ্রেশন নিউজিল্যান্ড আপনার আবেদনকে অগ্রাধিকার দেবে না। উপদেষ্টারা কেবল আপনাকে ইমিগ্রেশন সিস্টেমে সঠিক পথ খুঁজে নিতে সহায়তা করার জন্য কাজ করে। আপনাকে মিথ্যে কথা বলতে বলা হয়েছে চাকরি বা ভিসার যোগ্যতা অর্জনের জন্য মিথ্যা বলা বেআইনী। আপনার পরামর্শদাতা বা অন্য তৃতীয় পক্ষ আইন ভঙ্গ করছে যদি তারা আপনাকে এটি করার পরামর্শ দেয়। এটি একটি লক্ষণ যে তারা অন্যান্য ইমিগ্রেশন বা এমপ্লয়মেন্ট আইন লঙ্ঘন করতে পারে। এটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ যে আপনি যে তথ্য সরবরাহ করছেন তা সত্য। আপনার দেওয়া যে কোনও মিথ্যা বিবৃতি আপনার বর্তমান এবং ভবিষ্যতের ভিসা আবেদনগুলির উপর প্রভাব ফেলবে। আপনাকে বলা হয়েছে যে আপনার নিউজিল্যান্ডের অধিবাসীর মত একই ন্যূনতম কর্মসংস্থানের অধিকার নেই এটা সত্য নয়। অভিবাসী সহ নিউজিল্যান্ডের প্রত্যেকের সমান ন্যূনতম কর্মসংস্থানের অধিকার রয়েছে। এর মধ্যে অন্তর্ভুক্ত আছে বেতনসহ ছুটি এবং অসুস্থতার ছুটির অধিকার এবং অনিরাপদ কাজের অভ্যাস সম্পর্কে অভিযোগ করার অধিকার। যে ব্যক্তিরা বলে যে আপনার তা নেই তারা হয়ত ইমিগ্রেশন বা এমপ্লয়মেন্ট আইন লঙ্ঘন করছে। আপনাকে বাসস্থান সহ একটি প্যাকেজ চুক্তি অফার করা হয়েছে নিউজিল্যান্ডে চাকরির সাথে বাসস্থান দেওয়া সাধারণ নয়। কেবলমাত্র কিছু পরিস্থিতিতে, যেমন খামারে বা বাসস্থান সরবরাহকারীর জন্য কাজ করলে, এটি অর্থবহ। ভিসা, চাকরি এবং বাসস্থান সহ 'প্যাকেজ' অফার সম্পর্কে সতর্ক থাকুন -প্রতারকরা আপনাকে আবাসনের জন্য অতিরিক্ত পরিমাণ চার্জ করার চেষ্টা করতে পারে। আপনাকে বাসস্থানের প্রতিশ্রুতি দেওয়া হয়েছে নিউজিল্যান্ড পড়াশোনা এবং কাজ করার চমৎকার সুযোগ দেয়। একটি অস্থায়ী ভিসা আপনাকে এই সুযোগগুলি উপভোগ করতে দেবে, তবে কোনও গ্যারান্টি নেই যে এটির জন্য বাসস্থান পাওয়া যাবে। প্রতারকরা প্রায়শই বাসস্থান পাওয়ার সম্ভাবনাকে বাড়িয়ে বলে, তাই সাবধান হন কারণ বাসস্থান পাওয়ার রাস্তাগুলির জন্য নির্দিষ্ট দক্ষতা, অভিজ্ঞতা, যোগ্যতা বা পেশা প্রয়োজন। ভবিষ্যত উপার্জন, বাড়ি কেনা বা সরকারী সহায়তা অ্যাক্সেস করার প্রতিশ্রুতিগুলি আপনাকে যা অফার করা হচ্ছে তার উপর ভিত্তি করে আপনার এখানে আসার সিদ্ধান্ত নেওয়া উচিত, ভবিষ্যতের প্রতিশ্রুতিগুলির উপর নয় যা পালন নাও করা হতে পারে। সাধারণভাবে, আপনার কাছে আবাসিক ভিসা না থাকলে আপনি বাড়ি কিনতে বা সরকারী আর্থিক সহায়তা অ্যাক্সেস করতে পারবেন না। অতিরিক্ত অর্থ উপার্জনের জন্য আপনি অতিরিক্ত চাকরি করতে পারবেন না। আপনাকে বলা হয়েছে যে আপনাকে অবশ্যই একজন  উপদেষ্টা ব্যবহার করতে হবে ভিসার আবেদন করার জন্য আপনাকে উপদেষ্টা ব্যবহার করতে হবে না। আপনি আমাদের ওয়েবসাইটের তথ্য ব্যবহার করে নিজেরাই ভিসার জন্য আবেদন করতে পারেন। আপনি কোনও উপদেষ্টা ব্যবহার করতে চাইলে কেবলমাত্র লাইসেন্সপ্রাপ্ত ইমিগ্রেশন উপদেষ্টা (LIA), নিউজিল্যান্ডের একজন প্রত্যয়িত আইনজীবী বা ইমিগ্রেশন পরামর্শ দিতে আইনত  সক্ষম অন্য কাউকে ব্যবহার করুন। আপনি আপনার ভাষা, অবস্থান এবং বাজেটের উপর ভিত্তি করে LIA বেছে নিতে পারেন। আপনি আবেদনের আপডেট পাচ্ছেন না যদি আপনার উপদেষ্টা বা তৃতীয় পক্ষ আপনাকে আপনার আবেদন সম্পর্কে আপডেট না দেয় তবে আবেদনগুলি প্রক্রিয়া করতে কত  সময় নেয় তা জানতে আমাদের ওয়েবসাইটে যেতে পারেন। আপনি তথ্য না পাওয়ার কারণে যদি

নেওয়া ভাল, যাতে আপনি জানেন যে আপনি তাদের পরিষেবাগুলির জন্য ন্যায্য মূল্য পাচ্ছেন। নিশ্চিত হয়ে নিন যে আপনি ইমিগ্রেশন নিউজিল্যান্ডের অফিসিয়াল অনলাইন পরিষেবাগুলি অ্যাক্সেস করছেন। ‘.immigration.govt.nz’

সরাসরি কথা বলুন, যেমন একটি সাক্ষাৎকারের মাধ্যমে। দেশ থেকে স্থানান্তরিত হওয়া একটি বড় দায়িত্ব, তাই আপনি উপযুক্ত কিনা তা নিশ্চিত করার জন্য আপনার দক্ষতা সম্পর্কে সৎ হন। আপনার সন্দেহ থাকলে আমাদের সাথে যোগাযোগ করুন। আমরা আপনার ভিসার বিকল্পগুলি এবং আপনাকে কেউ যে তথ্য বলেছে তা সঠিক বা বাস্তবসম্মত কিনা তা বোঝানোর জন্য সহায়তা করতে পারি। আমরা আপনাকে আপনার আবেদন সম্পর্কে তথ্য সরবরাহ করতে পারি। যদি ইংরেজি

        "main_content": "如果您打算获得来新西兰的签证，请提防那些可能窃取您的钱或为您注册与他们承诺不符的工作的人的欺诈。 以下是要注意的骗局，以及您可以采取的步骤来帮助保护自己免受诈骗或签证欺诈。 如果您已经在新西兰工作， 并认为自己受到剥削 ，请不要害怕向新西兰移民局（INZ）寻求帮助。我们和新西兰就业部门可以为您提供帮助，并在需要时采取行动。 检查诈骗迹象 如果您看到这些骗局迹象，停下来并采取额外的预防措施。询问并寻求官方建议。您可以与我们谈谈您的疑虑。 要求您为工作付费 请留言您是否被要求为您的工作支付费用，有时称为“处理”或“安置”费用。 新西兰雇主不能向您收取工作费用或让您支付任何招聘费用。这包括间接通过第三方，然后要求您向他们付款。 如果您正在使用： 招聘机构，请警惕他们想直接向您收取的任何高额费用。招聘机构收取的任何费用都应反映他们为您提供的服务。 移民顾问，您需要为他们的服务支付合理的价格。 新西兰移民局只向您收取申请费。在为您的申请获取证明时，您可能需要支付费用，例如体检。 获得申请优先权和接触移民官的机会 在这种骗局中，您的顾问、代理人、咨询师或其他第三方会表示，他们可以利用自己的关系来保证结果或让决定更快做出。 没有规定要求您使用顾问。新西兰移民局： 不会因为您使用顾问而优先考虑您的申请，并且 只会根据移民法规评估其拥有的信息来决定申请。 获得申请优先权和接触移民官的机会 在这种骗局中，您的顾问、代理人、咨询师或其他第三方会说他们有内幕消息或可以联系移民官员来优先考虑您的申请。 没有规定要求您使用顾问。 如果有顾问，新西兰移民局也不会优先考虑您的申请。顾问只是帮助您熟悉移民系统。 您被要求撒谎 为了获得工作或签证的资格而撒谎是非法的。 如果您的顾问或其他第三方建议您这样做，则构成违法行为。这表明他们可能违反其他移民或就业法规。 您提供的信息必须真实，这一点很重要。您所做的任何虚假陈述都将影响您当前和未来的签证申请。 您被告知您没有与新西兰人相同的最低就业权利 这不正确。新西兰的每个人都享有相同的最低就业权利，包括移民。这包括带薪假期和病假的权利，以及投诉不安全工作做法的权利。 说您没有这些权力的人的人可能违反了移民法或就业法。 为您提供住宿套餐 在新西兰，提供工作住宿并不常见。 只有在某些情况下，例如在农场工作或为旅馆等住宿业工作，这才有可能。 警惕签证、工作和住宿的“套餐”优惠——诈骗者可能会试图向您收取过高的住宿费用。 您被承诺居留权 新西兰提供了绝佳的学习和工作机会。临时签证允许您享受这些机会，但不能保证此后您一定会获得居留权。 诈骗者经常夸大获得居留权的可能性，因此请注意，因为获得居留权的途径需要某些技能、经验、资格或职业。 对未来收入、购房或获得政府支持的承诺 您应该根据当前所提供的条件来决定迁居到这里，而不是根据未来可能无法兑现的承诺。 一般来说，除非您持有居留签证，否则您无法购买房屋或获得政府的经济补贴。您不能为了赚取外快而从事额外的工作。 您被告知必须使用顾问 没有规定要求您使用顾问来申请签证。您可以使用我们网站上的信息自行申请签证。 如果您选择使用顾问，请仅使用持牌移民顾问（LIA）、经过认证的新西兰律师或其他依法能够提供移民建议的人。您可以根据您的语言、位置和预算选择 LIA。 您没有获得申请情况的更新 如果您的顾问或第三方没有向您提供有关您申请的最新信息，您可以访问我们的网站了解处理申请需要多长时间。 如果您因为没有收到信息而担心，您可以直接致电我们验证申请。 您没有获取我们的官方在线服务 我们发现有一些诈骗网站冒充新西兰移民局提供一些在线服务。请您使用官方链接获取服务，以确保不会误入虚假网站。您可以检查网址进行确认，其中必须完整包含“.immigration.govt.nz”字段。请仔细检查，因为诈骗网站的网址可能看起来很相似。如有怀疑，请直接通过我们的网站访问我们的在线服务。 保护自己免受诈骗的方法 没有规定要求您使用顾问。如果您选择使用顾问，请仅使用持牌移民顾问、经过认证的新西兰律师或其他依法能够提供移民建议的人。 如果您选择使用顾问或招聘机构，最好比较其价格，这样您就知道他们的服务收费是否合理。 请确保您使用的是新西兰移民局的官方线上服务。请仔细检查网址，确保其包含“.immigration.govt.nz”完整字段，或通过我们的网站访问我们的服务。 确认您的潜在雇主已获得认证。在雇用持有认证雇主工作签证的员工之前，所有雇主必须首先获得认证。使用我们的在线工具来确认这一点。 直接与您的潜在雇主交谈，例如通过面试。搬家到他国是一件大事，因此请诚实地说明您的技能，以确保您适合这个职位。 如果您有任何疑问，请联系我们。我们可以帮助解释您的签证选择以及您获知的信息是否准确或现实。我们可以为您提供有关您申请的信息。如果英语不是您的第一语言，我们可以为您联系口译员。 如果可以的话，请询问有过同样的新西兰经历的国人，以便进一步了解情况。 如果您的雇主提供住宿，请索要照片并访问租赁服务网站，比较该地区房产类型的市场租金，并了解您作为租户的权利。 了解新西兰，包括生活费用和医疗保健情况。我们的生活和工作网站提供有用的信息。 了解您在新西兰工作的就业权利。新西兰就业局网站提供多种语言的有用信息，以及关于基本权利、责任和解决就业问题的免费学习单元。"

        "main_content": "如果您計劃獲得前往紐西蘭的簽證，要警惕可能詐騙您的人，竊取您的錢或讓您註冊不符承諾的工作。 以下是要注意的詐騙行為，以及您可以採取的步驟以幫助自己免受詐騙或簽證欺詐。 如果您已在紐西蘭工作， 並認為自己正受到剝削 ，請不要害怕向紐西蘭移民局（INZ）尋求幫助。我們和紐西蘭就業部門可以幫助您，並在需要時采取行動。 檢查詐騙的跡象 如果您看到以下詐騙的跡象，請停下來並採取額外的預防措施。詢問並尋求官方建議。您可以與我們討論您的疑慮。 要求您為工作付費 請留意您是否被要求為工作支付費用，有時稱為“處理”或“安置”費。 紐西蘭僱主不能向您收取工作費用或讓您支付任何招聘費用。這包括間接通過第三方，然後第三方要求您付款。 如果您正在使用： 招聘機構，對他們直接向您收取的任何高額費用要保持警惕。來自招聘機構的任何費用都應反映他們為您提供的服務。 移民顧問，您需要為他們的服務支付合理的價格。 紐西蘭移民局只向您收取申請費。在獲取申請證明時，您可能需要支付費用，例如體檢。 獲得申請優先權和聯絡移民官的機會 在這種騙局中，您的顧問、代理、咨詢師或其他第三方可能會聲稱他們可以利用他們的關係來保證結果或加快決策。 沒有規定要求您聘請顧問。紐西蘭移民局： 不會因為您使用顧問而優先考慮您的申請，並且 只會根據移民法規評估其所掌握的資訊來決定申請。 獲得申請優先權和聯絡移民官的機會 在這種騙局中，您的顧問、代理人、咨詢師或其他第三方會說他們擁有內幕消息或可以聯繫移民官員來優先考慮您的申請。 沒有規定要求您聘請顧問。 如果您有顧問，紐西蘭移民局也不會優先處理您的申請。顧問只是幫助您熟悉移民系統。 要求您撒謊 為了符合工作或簽證資格而撒謊是違法的。 如果您的顧問或其他第三方建議您這樣做，他們就違法了。這是他們可能違反其他移民或就業法規的跡象。 您提供的資料必須真實，這一點很重要。您做出的任何虛假陳述將影響您目前和將來的簽證申請。 被告知您不享有與紐西蘭人相同的最低就業權利 這並不正確。在紐西蘭，每個人都享有相同的最低就業權利，包括移民。這包括享有帶薪假期和病假的權利，以及有權對不安全的工作做出投訴。 聲稱您沒有這些權利的人可能違反移民或就業法律。 為您提供住宿套餐 在紐西蘭，工作通常不會提供住宿。 只有在一些情況下，比如在農場工作或為旅館等住宿行業工作時，這才有可能。 對於帶有簽證、工作和住宿的“套餐”優惠要保持警覺 — 詐騙者可能會試圖向您收取過高的住宿費用。 承諾居留權 紐西蘭提供了學習和工作的絕佳機會。臨時簽證可以讓您享受這些機會，但不能保證此後您一定會獲得居留權。 詐騙者通常會夸大居留的可能性，因此要注意，獲得居留權的途徑通常需要特定的技能、經驗、資格或職業。 對未來收入、購房或獲取政府支持的承諾 您應該根據當前所提供的條件來決定遷居到這裡，而不是根據未來可能無法兌現的承諾。 通常情況下，除非您持有居留簽證，否則您無法購房或獲取政府的經濟補助。您也不能從事額外的工作來賺取外快。 您被告知必須聘請顧問 沒有規定要求您聘請顧問來申請簽證。您可以使用我們網站上的資訊來自行申請簽證。 如果您選擇使用顧問，請使用有執照的移民顧問 (LIA)、經過認證的紐西蘭律師或其他能夠合法提供移民建議的人。您可以根據您的語言、所在位置和預算來選擇LIA。 您未獲得申請的最新資訊 如果您的顧問或第三方未向您提供申請的最新資訊，您可以前往我們的網站查詢處理申請所需的時間。 如果您因未能獲得資訊而感到擔憂，您可以直接致電我們以便驗證申請。 您沒有獲取我們的官方線上服務 我們發現有詐騙網站偽冒紐西蘭移民局提供某些線上服務。請您使用官方連結獲取服務，以確保不會誤入虛假網站。您可以檢查網址進行確認，其中必須完整包含「.immigration.govt.nz」字段。請仔細檢查，因為詐騙網站的網址可能看起來很相似。如有懷疑，請直接透過我們的網站獲取線上服務。 保護自己免受詐騙的方法 沒有規定要求您聘請顧問。如果您選擇使用顧問，請僅使用有執照的移民顧問、經過認證的紐西蘭律師或其他能夠合法提供移民建議的人。 如果您選擇使用顧問或招聘機構，最好比較其收費，以確保您為他們的服務支付了合理的價格。 請確保您使用的是紐西蘭移民局的官方線上服務。請仔細檢查網址，確保其包含「.immigration.govt.nz」完整字段，或通過我們的網站獲取服務。 確認您潛在的雇主是否獲得認證。在雇用持有認證雇主工作簽證的員工之前，所有雇主必須首先獲得認證。使用我們的線上工具來確認這一點。 直接與您潛在的雇主溝通，比如進行面試。跨國移居是一件大事，因此請誠實的說明您的技能，確保您是否適合這個職位。 如果您有疑慮，請聯繫我們。我們可以幫助解釋您的簽證選擇，以及您所聽到的資訊是否準確或現實。我們可以為您提供有關您的申請的資訊。如果英語不是您的母語，我們可以為您提供口譯服務。 如果可以的話，請詢問有過同樣的紐西蘭經歷的國人，以便進一步了解情況。 如果您的雇主提供住宿，請索取照片，並進入租賃服務網站，比較該地區此類住宿的市場租賃價格，並了解您作為租戶的權利。 了解紐西蘭，包括生活成本和醫療保健的情況。我們的生活和工作網站提供了有用的資訊。 了解您在紐西蘭工作的就業權利。Employment New Zealand網站提供多種語言的有用資訊，以及有關基本權利、責任和解決就業問題的免費學習單元。"

        "main_content": "यदि तपाईं न्युजिल्याण्ड आउने भिसा प्राप्त गर्ने योजना बनाउँदै हुनुहुन्छ भने तपाईंको पैसा ठगी गर्ने वा तिनीहरूले प्रतिबद्धता गरेको काम नभई अरु नै काममा तपाईंलाई लगाउन सक्ने मानिसहरूबाट सतर्क रहनुहोस्। ठगी वा भिसा सम्बन्धी ठगीहरूबाट बच्न सघाउने तपाईंले अपनाउन सक्ने कुरा वा कदमहरू तल दिइएका छन्। यदि तपाईं पहिलेदेखि नै न्युजिल्याण्डमा काम गर्दै हुनुहुन्छ र आफ्नो शोषण भइरहेको छ जस्तो लाग्छ भने इमिग्रेसन न्युजिल्याण्ड (INZ) सँग सहयोग माग्न नडराउनुहोस्। हामी र इम्प्लोइमेन्ट न्युजिल्याण्डले तपाईंलाई मद्दत गर्न सक्दछ र आवश्यक परेमा कारबाही गर्न सक्छ। ठगीका संकेतहरू थाहा पाउनुहोस् यदि तपाईंले ठगीका यी संकेतहरू देख्नुभएमा रोकिनुहोस् र थप सावधानी अपनाउनुहोस्। प्रश्नहरू सोध्नुहोस् र आधिकारिक सल्लाह लिनुहोस्। तपाईं हामीसँग आफ्नो चिन्ताका बारेमा कुरा गर्न सक्नुहुन्छ। तपाईंलाई आफ्नो कामको लागि पैसा तिर्न लगाइएको छ यदि तपाईंलाई आफ्नो कामको लागि कहिलेकाँही यसलाई 'प्रोसेसिङ' वा 'प्लेसमेन्ट' शुल्क भनिने शुल्क तिर्न लगाइएको छ भने सावधान हुनुहोस्। न्युजिल्याण्डका रोजगारदाताहरूले तपाईंलाई कामको लागि शुल्क लिन सक्दैनन् वा उनीहरूले कुनै पनि रिक्रुटमेन्ट खर्च तिर्न लगाउँदैनन्। यसमा अप्रत्यक्ष रूपमा तेस्रो पक्ष मार्फत लिने कुरा पर्छ जसले तपाईंलाई तिनीहरूलाई भुक्तानी गर्न माग गर्छन्। यदि तपाईं निम्न कुरा प्रयोग गर्दै हुनुहुन्छ भने: रिक्रुटमेन्ट एजेन्सी, उनीहरूले तपाईंलाई सोझै तिराउन चाहने कुनै पनि उच्च शुल्कको बारेमा सावधान रहनुहोस्। रिक्रुटमेन्ट एजेन्सीले लगाउने कुनै पनि शुल्कले उनीहरूले तपाईंलाई प्रदान गर्ने सेवालाई दर्शाउनुपर्छ। कुनै इमिग्रेसन सल्लाहकार, तपाईंले तिनीहरूको सेवाहरूको लागि उचित मूल्य तिर्नुपर्छ। इमिग्रेसन न्युजिल्याण्डले तपाईंलाई आवेदन शुल्क मात्र लिन्छ। मेडिकल पूरा गर्ने जस्तो तपाईंको आवेदनको लागि प्रमाणहरू सङ्कलन गर्दा तपाईंले खर्चहरू तिर्नुपर्ने हुनसक्छ। आवेदनको प्राथमिकता र इमिग्रेसन अधिकृतहरू समक्ष पहुँच प्राप्त गर्ने यस्तो ठगीबाट तपाईंको सल्लाहकार, एजेन्ट, परामर्शदाता वा अन्य तेस्रो पक्षले आफ्नो सम्पर्कको प्रयोग गरी काम गर्न सक्ने वा छिटो काम गर्ने ग्यारेण्टी दिन्छन्। तपाईंले सल्लाहकार प्रयोग गर्नु पर्दैन। इमिग्रेसन न्युजिल्याण्ड: ले तपाईंसँग सल्लाहकार भएकै कारण तपाईंको आवेदनलाई प्राथमिकतामा राख्ने छैन र आफूसँग भएका सूचनाको मूल्यांकन गरेर इमिग्रेसन नियम अनुसार मात्र आवेदनहरूमा निर्णय लिन्छ आवेदनको प्राथमिकता र इमिग्रेसन अधिकृतहरू समक्ष पहुँच प्राप्त गर्ने यस ठगीमा तपाईंको सल्लाहकार, एजेन्ट, परामर्शदाता वा अन्य तेस्रो पक्षले तपाईंको आवेदनलाई प्राथमिकतामा राख्न उनीहरूसँग भित्री कुरा थाहा भएको वा इमिग्रेसन अधिकृतहरूसँग पहुँच भएको भन्नेछन्। तपाईंले सल्लाहकार प्रयोग गर्नु पर्दैन। यदि तपाईंले त्यसो गर्नु भएमा इमिग्रेसन न्युजिल्याण्डले तपाईंको आवेदनलाई प्राथमिकता दिने छैन। सल्लाहकारहरूले तपाईंलाई इमिग्रेसन प्रणाली नेभिगेट गर्नको लागि मात्र सहायोग गर्न काम गर्छन्। तपाईंलाई झुटो बोल्न लगाइएको छ कुनै काम वा भिसाको लागि योग्य हुनको लागि झुटो बोल्नु गैरकानूनी हुन्छ। यदि तपाईंको सल्लाहकार वा अन्य तेस्रो पक्षले तपाईंलाई यसो गर्न सल्लाह दिएमा उनीहरूले कानून उल्लङ्घन गर्दैछन्। यो उनीहरूले अन्य इमिग्रेसन वा रोजगार सम्बन्धी कानूनहरू उल्लङ्घन गर्न सक्ने सङ्केत हो। तपाईंले प्रदान गर्नुभएको जानकारी सत्य हुन जरुरी छ। तपाईंले दिनुभएको कुनै पनि गलत बयानहरूले तपाईंको हालको र भविष्यको भिसा आवेदनहरूलाई असर गर्नेछ। तपाईंसँग न्युजिल्याण्डका स्थानीयहरूको जस्तो न्यूनतम रोजगारीको अधिकार छैन भनेर तपाईंलाई बताइएको छ यो कुरा सत्य होइन। न्युजिल्याण्डमा आप्रवासीहरू लगायत प्रत्येक व्यक्तिसँग समान न्यूनतम रोजगारी अधिकारहरू छन्। यसमा तलबी बिदा र बिरामी बिदाको अधिकार र असुरक्षित कार्य अभ्यासहरूको बारेमा गुनासो गर्ने अधिकार पर्दछन्। तपाईंसँग यो अधिकार छैन भन्ने मानिसहरूले इमिग्रेसन वा रोजगारीका कानूनहरू उल्लङ्घन गरिरहेका हुन सक्छन्। तपाईंलाई आवास सुविधा सहितको प्याकेज सम्झौता प्रस्ताव गरिएको छ न्युजिल्याण्डमा रोजगारी सहित आवासको सुविधा प्रदान गरिनु सामान्य कुरा होइन। फार्ममा वा आवास प्रदायकको लागि काम गर्दा जस्ता केही परिस्थितिहरूमा मात्र यसले अर्थ राख्छ। भिसा, काम र आवासको साथमा ‘प्याकेज’ प्रस्तावहरूको बारेमा सतर्क रहनुहोस् – स्क्यामरहरूले तपाईंलाई आवासको लागि अत्यधिक रकम असुल्ने प्रयास गर्न सक्छन्। तपाईंलाई आवास सुविधाको प्रतिबद्धता दिइएको छ न्युजिल्याण्डले अध्ययन र काम गर्ने उत्कृष्ट अवसरहरू प्रदान गर्छ। अस्थायी भिसाले तपाईंलाई यी अवसरहरूको अनुमति दिनेछ तर आवास सुविधा नै दिनेछ भनेर कुनै ग्यारेन्टी छैन। स्क्यामरहरूले प्रायः आवास सुविधाको सम्भावना कत्तिको छ भनेर बढाइ-चढाई कुरा गर्छन्, आवास प्राप्त गर्न निश्चित सीप, अनुभव, योग्यता वा पेशाहरू आवश्यक पर्ने भएकाले सावधान रहनुहोस्। भविष्यको आम्दानी, घर खरिद गर्ने वा सरकारी सहयोगमा पहुँच गर्ने प्रतिबद्धताहरू तपाईंलाई प्रस्ताव गरिएका कुराहरूको आधारमा तपाईंले यहाँ आउने निर्णय गर्नुपर्छ, भविष्यमा गरिएका प्रतिबद्धताहरूको आधारमा होइन। सामान्यतया: तपाईंसँग आवासीय भिसा नभएसम्म तपाईंले घर किन्न वा सरकारी आर्थिक सहयोगमा पहुँच गर्न सक्नुहुन्न। तपाईं अतिरिक्त पैसा कमाउन थप कामहरू गर्न सक्नुहुन्न। तपाईंलाई सल्लाहकार प्रयोग गर्नुपर्छ भनेर भनिन्छ तपाईंले भिसाको लागि आवेदन गर्न सल्लाहकार प्रयोग गर्न आवश्यक छैन। तपाईंले हाम्रो वेबसाइटमा भएको जानकारी प्रयोग गरेर भिसाको लागि आफैले आवेदन दिन सक्नुहुन्छ। यदि तपाईंले सल्लाहकार प्रयोग गर्ने निधो गर्नुभयो भने लाइसेन्स प्राप्त अध्यागमन सल्लाहकार (LIA), न्युजिल्याण्डका प्रमाणित वकिल वा कानुनी रूपमा इमिग्रेसनको बारेमा सल्लाह प्रदान गर्न सक्ने अरू कसैलाई मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुहोस्। तपाईंले आफ्नो भाषा, स्थान र बजेटको आधारमा LIA हरू छनौट गर्न सक्नुहुन्छ। तपाईंले आवेदन सम्बन्धी अपडेटहरू प्राप्त गरिरहनुभएको छैन यदि तपाईंको सल्लाहकार वा तेस्रो पक्षले तपाईंलाई तपाईंको आवेदनको बारेमा अपडेट दिइरहेको छैन भने तपाईंले हाम्रो वेबसाइटमा गएर आवेदनहरू प्रोसेस गर्न कति समय लाग्छ भनेर पत्ता लगाउन सक्नुहुन्छ। तपाईं जानकारी प्राप्त गरिरहनुभएको छैन भनेर चिन्तित हुनुहुन्छ भने तपाईंले आवेदन प्रमाणित गर्न हामीलाई सोझै फोन गर्न सक्नुहुन्छ। तपाईं हाम्रो आधिकारिक अनलाइन सेवाहरूमा पहुँच गरिरहनुभएको छैन हामी अध्यागमन न्यूजील्याण्डको अनलाइन सेवाहरूको नाममा केही स्क्याम वेबसाइटहरूको बारेमा सचेत छौं । तपाईंलाई नक्कली वेबसाइटहरूमा भिजिट गराउनको लागि चलाखी नगरिएको सुनिश्चित गर्नको लागि यी सेवाहरूको लागि हाम्रो आधिकारिक लिङ्कहरू प्रयोग गर्नुहोस् । तपाईंले वेबसाइटको एड्रेसमा ठ्याक्कै ‘.immigration.govt.nz’ भएको कुराको जाँच गरेर यसको पुष्टि गर्न सक्नुहुन्छ । स्क्याम वेबसाइट ठेगानाहरू समान देखिन सक्ने भएकोले सावधानीपूर्वक जाँच गर्नुहोस् । यदि शंका लागेमा, हाम्रो वेबसाइट मार्फत सोझै हाम्रो अनलाइन सेवाहरूमा पहुँच गर्नुहोस् । ठगीबाट आफूलाई सुरक्षित राख्ने तरिकाहरू तपाईंले सल्लाहकार प्रयोग गर्नु पर्दैन। यदि तपाईंले सल्लाहकार प्रयोग गर्ने निधो गर्नुभयो भने लाइसेन्स प्राप्त अध्यागमन सल्लाहकार (LIA), न्युजिल्याण्डका प्रमाणित वकिल वा कानुनी रूपमा इमिग्रेसनको बारेमा सल्लाह प्रदान गर्न सक्ने अरू कसैलाई मात्र प्रयोग गर्नुहोस्। यदि तपाईं कुनै सल्लाहकार वा रिक्रुटमेन्ट एजेन्सी प्रयोग गर्न चाहनुहुन्छ भने तिनीहरूको शुल्कहरू जाँच गर्नु राम्रो कुरा हो जसबाट तपाईंलाई तपाईंले तिनीहरूको सेवाहरूको लागि उचित मूल्य प्राप्त गर्दै हुनुहुन्छ भन्ने थाहा हुन्छ। तपाईंले अध्यागमन न्यूजिल्यान्डको आधिकारिक अनलाइन सेवाहरूमा पहुँच गरिरहनुभएको कुरा निश्चित गर्नुहोस्। यसमा ठ्याक्कै ‘.immigration.govt.nz’ समावेश भएको सुनिश्चित गर्नको लागि सावधानीपूर्वक वेबसाइट एड्रेसको जाँच गर्नुहोस् वा हाम्रो वेबसाइट मार्फत हाम्रो सेवाहरूमा पहुँच गर्नुहोस् । तपाईंको सम्भावित रोजगारदाता मान्यता प्राप्त भएको पुष्टि गर्नुहोस्। मान्यता प्राप्त रोजगारदाता कामदार भिसामा कामदारहरू नियुक्त गर्ने सबै रोजगारदाताहरू पहिले मान्यता प्राप्त हुनुपर्छ। तिनीहरूले हाम्रो अनलाइन सामग्री प्रयोग गरिरहेको कुरा पुष्टि गर्नुहोस्। तपाईंको सम्भावित रोजगारदातासँग अन्तरवार्ता जस्ता माध्यमबाट सोझै कुरा गर्नुहोस्। कुनै देशमा जानु ठूलो प्रतिबद्धता हो, त्यसैले तपाईं राम्ररी फिट हुनुहुन्छ भनेर सुनिश्चित गर्न आफ्नो सीपको बारेमा इमान्दार हुनुहोस्। यदि तपाईंलाई कुनै शंका भएमा हामीलाई सम्पर्क गर्नुहोस्। हामी तपाईंको भिसाका विकल्पहरू व्याख्या गर्न र तपाईंलाई कसैले बताएको जानकारी सही वा यथार्थ छ कि छैन भनेर सहयोग गर्न सक्छौं। हामी तपाईंलाई तपाईंको आवेदनको बारेमा जानकारी प्रदान गर्न सक्छौं। यदि अंग्रेजी तपाईंको पहिलो भाषा होइन भने, हामी तपाईंलाई दोभाषेसँग जोड्न सक्छौं। यदि सक्नुहुन्छ भने, न्युजिल्याण्डको उस्तै यात्रा गरेका तपाईंको देशका मानिसहरूलाई सोधेर थप अनुसन्धान गर्नुहोस्। यदि तपाईंको रोजगारदाताले आवास सुविधा प्रदान गरिरहेको छ भने, फोटोहरू माग्नुहोस् र भाडा सम्बन्धी सेवा वेबसाइटमा जानुहोस् र त्यस क्षेत्रमा रहेको सम्पत्तिको प्रकारको बजारको भाडा तुलना गर्नुहोस् र भाडावालको रूपमा तपाईंको अधिकारहरूको बारेमा थाहा पाउनुहोस्। जीवनयापन गर्न आवश्यक खर्च र स्वास्थ्य सेवाको पहुँच लगायत न्युजिल्याण्डको बारेमा थाहा पाउनुहोस्। हाम्रो लिभ एण्ड वर्क वेबसाइटमा उपयोगी जानकारी छ। न्युजिल्याण्डको कामदारको हैसियतमा तपाईंको रोजगार अधिकारहरूको बारेमा थाहा पाउनुहोस्। इम्प्लोइमेन्ट न्युजिल्याण्ड वेबसाइटमा थुप्रै भाषाहरूमा उपयोगी जानकारी र न्यूनतम अधिकार, जिम्मेवारीहरू र रोजगार समस्याहरू समाधान गर्न निःशुल्क सिकाइका मोड्युलहरू छन्।"

ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਦੇ ਰੋਜ਼ਗਾਰਦਾਤਾ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਤੋਂ ਨੌਕਰੀ ਲਈ ਫੀਸ ਨਹੀਂ ਲੈ ਸਕਦੇ ਜਾਂ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਭਰਤੀ ਦੀ ਲਾਗਤ ਦਾ ਭੁਗਤਾਨ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਮਜਬੂਰ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੇ। ਇਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਅਸਿੱਧੇ ਤੌਰ 'ਤੇ ਇੱਕ ਤੀਜੀ ਧਿਰ ਦੁਆਰਾ ਸ਼ਾਮਲ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਫਿਰ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਤੋਂ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਭੁਗਤਾਨ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਮੰਗ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਜੇਕਰ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰ ਰਹੇ ਹੋ: ਇੱਕ ਭਰਤੀ ਏਜੰਸੀ ਦੀ, ਤਾਂ ਕਿਸੇ ਵੀ ਉੱਚੀ ਫੀਸ ਤੋਂ ਸਾਵਧਾਨ ਰਹੋ ਜੋ ਉਹ ਸਿੱਧੇ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਤੋਂ ਵਸੂਲਣਾ ਚਾਹੁੰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇੱਕ ਭਰਤੀ ਏਜੰਸੀ ਤੋਂ ਕੋਈ ਵੀ ਖਰਚਾ ਉਸ ਸੇਵਾ ਨੂੰ ਦਰਸਾਉਣਾ ਚਾਹੀਦਾ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਉਹ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਪ੍ਰਦਾਨ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇੱਕ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ, ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ ਲਈ ਇੱਕ ਉਚਿਤ ਕੀਮਤ ਅਦਾ ਕਰਨੀ ਪਵੇਗੀ। ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਤੋਂ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇੱਕ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਫੀਸ ਲੈਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਆਪਣੀ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਲਈ ਸਬੂਤ ਇਕੱਠੇ ਕਰਨ ਵੇਲੇ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਲਾਗਤਾਂ ਦਾ ਭੁਗਤਾਨ ਕਰਨਾ ਪੈ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕਿ ਮੈਡੀਕਲ ਨੂੰ ਪੂਰਾ ਕਰਨਾ। ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਦੀ ਤਰਜੀਹ ਅਤੇ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਅਫਸਰਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕਰਨਾ ਇਸ ਘੁਟਾਲੇ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ, ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ, ਏਜੰਟ, ਕੰਸਲਟੈਂਟ ਜਾਂ ਹੋਰ ਤੀਜੀ ਧਿਰ ਦਾ ਕਹਿਣਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਨਤੀਜੇ ਜਾਂ ਤੇਜ਼ ਫੈਸਲੇ ਦੀ ਗਰੰਟੀ ਲਈ ਆਪਣੇ ਕਨੈਕਸ਼ਨਾਂ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ। ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ। ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ: ਤੁਹਾਡੀ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਨੂੰ ਤਰਜੀਹ ਨਹੀਂ ਦੇਵੇਗਾ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਇੱਕ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਦੇ ਹੋ, ਅਤੇ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਨਿਯਮਾਂ ਦੇ ਵਿਰੁੱਧ ਇਸ ਕੋਲ ਮੌਜੂਦ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਦਾ ਮੁਲਾਂਕਣ ਕਰਕੇ ਅਰਜ਼ੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਫੈਸਲਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਦੀ ਤਰਜੀਹ ਅਤੇ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਅਫਸਰਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕਰਨਾ ਇਸ ਘੁਟਾਲੇ ਨਾਲ, ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ, ਏਜੰਟ, ਮਾਹਰ ਜਾਂ ਕੋਈ ਹੋਰ ਤੀਜੀ ਧਿਰ ਕਹੇਗੀ ਕਿ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਕੋਲ ਤੁਹਾਡੀ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਨੂੰ ਤਰਜੀਹ ਦੇਣ ਲਈ ਅੰਦਰੂਨੀ ਗਿਆਨ ਜਾਂ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਅਫਸਰਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਹੈ। ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ। ਜੇਕਰ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਅਜਿਹਾ ਕਰਦੇ ਹੋ ਤਾਂ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਤੁਹਾਡੀ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਨੂੰ ਤਰਜੀਹ ਨਹੀਂ ਦੇਵੇਗਾ। ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਵਿਵਸਥਾ ਨੂੰ ਨੈਵੀਗੇਟ ਕਰਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਤੁਹਾਡੀ ਮਦਦ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਕੰਮ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਝੂਠ ਬੋਲਣ ਲਈ ਕਿਹਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਨੌਕਰੀ ਜਾਂ ਵੀਜ਼ਾ ਲਈ ਯੋਗਤਾ ਪੂਰੀ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਝੂਠ ਬੋਲਣਾ ਗੈਰ-ਕਾਨੂੰਨੀ ਹੈ। ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਜਾਂ ਕੋਈ ਹੋਰ ਤੀਜੀ ਧਿਰ ਕਾਨੂੰਨ ਦੀ ਉਲੰਘਣਾ ਕਰ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ ਜੇਕਰ ਉਹ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਅਜਿਹਾ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਸਲਾਹ ਦਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਹ ਇੱਕ ਸੰਕੇਤ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਹੋਰ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਜਾਂ ਰੁਜ਼ਗਾਰ ਕਾਨੂੰਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਤੋੜ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਹ ਮਹੱਤਵਪੂਰਨ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਦੁਆਰਾ ਪ੍ਰਦਾਨ ਕੀਤੀ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਸੱਚੀ ਹੈ। ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਵੱਲੋਂ ਦਿੱਤੇ ਗਏ ਕੋਈ ਵੀ ਗਲਤ ਬਿਆਨ ਤੁਹਾਡੀ ਮੌਜੂਦਾ ਅਤੇ ਭਵਿੱਖੀ ਵੀਜ਼ਾ ਅਰਜ਼ੀਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਿਤ ਕਰਨਗੇ। ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਦੱਸਿਆ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਕੋਲ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਵਾਸੀਆਂ ਵਾਂਗ ਘੱਟੋ-ਘੱਟ ਰੁਜ਼ਗਾਰ ਅਧਿਕਾਰ ਨਹੀਂ ਹਨ ਇਹ ਸੱਚ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ। ਪ੍ਰਵਾਸੀਆਂ ਸਮੇਤ, ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਹਰੇਕ ਕੋਲ ਇੱਕੋ ਜਿਹੇ ਘੱਟੋ-ਘੱਟ ਰੁਜ਼ਗਾਰ ਅਧਿਕਾਰ ਹਨ। ਇਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਅਦਾਇਗੀ ਛੁੱਟੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਬਿਮਾਰੀ ਦੀ ਛੁੱਟੀ ਦਾ ਅਧਿਕਾਰ, ਅਤੇ ਅਸੁਰੱਖਿਅਤ ਕੰਮ ਦੇ ਅਭਿਆਸਾਂ ਬਾਰੇ ਸ਼ਿਕਾਇਤ ਕਰਨ ਦਾ ਅਧਿਕਾਰ ਸ਼ਾਮਲ ਹੈ। ਉਹ ਲੋਕ ਜੋ ਕਹਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ ਕਿ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਕੋਲ ਨਹੀਂ ਹਨ, ਹੋ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਜਾਂ ਰੁਜ਼ਗਾਰ ਕਾਨੂੰਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਤੋੜ ਰਹੇ ਹੋਣ। ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਰਿਹਾਇਸ਼ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਪੈਕੇਜ ਸੌਦੇ ਦੀ ਪੇਸ਼ਕਸ਼ ਕੀਤੀ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਵਿੱਚ ਨੌਕਰੀ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਰਿਹਾਇਸ਼ ਮੁਹੱਈਆ ਕਰਵਾਉਣਾ ਆਮ ਗੱਲ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ। ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਕੁਝ ਸਥਿਤੀਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਇਹ ਅਰਥ ਰੱਖਦਾ ਹੈ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕਿ ਫਾਰਮ 'ਤੇ ਕੰਮ ਕਰਨਾ ਜਾਂ ਇੱਕ ਰਿਹਾਇਸ਼ ਪ੍ਰਦਾਤਾ ਲਈ। ਵੀਜ਼ਾ, ਨੌਕਰੀ ਅਤੇ ਰਿਹਾਇਸ਼ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ 'ਪੈਕੇਜ' ਪੇਸ਼ਕਸ਼ਾਂ ਬਾਰੇ ਸਾਵਧਾਨ ਰਹੋ – ਘੁਟਾਲੇ ਕਰਨ ਵਾਲੇ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਤੋਂ ਰਿਹਾਇਸ਼ ਲਈ ਬਹੁਤ ਜ਼ਿਆਦਾ ਰਕਮ ਵਸੂਲਣ ਦੀ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ। ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਰਿਹਾਇਸ਼ ਦਾ ਵਾਅਦਾ ਕੀਤਾ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਅਧਿਐਨ ਕਰਨ ਅਤੇ ਕੰਮ ਕਰਨ ਦੇ ਸ਼ਾਨਦਾਰ ਮੌਕੇ ਪ੍ਰਦਾਨ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇੱਕ ਅਸਥਾਈ ਵੀਜ਼ਾ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਇਹਨਾਂ ਮੌਕਿਆਂ ਦਾ ਆਨੰਦ ਲੈਣ ਦੀ ਇਜਾਜ਼ਤ ਦੇਵੇਗਾ, ਪਰ ਇਸਦੀ ਕੋਈ ਗਾਰੰਟੀ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਇਹ ਨਿਵਾਸ ਲਈ ਅਗਵਾਈ ਕਰੇਗਾ। ਘੁਟਾਲੇਬਾਜ਼ ਅਕਸਰ ਇਹ ਦੱਸਦੇ ਹਨ ਕਿ ਰਿਹਾਇਸ਼ ਦੀ ਸੰਭਾਵਨਾ ਕਿੰਨੀ ਹੈ, ਇਸ ਲਈ ਸੁਚੇਤ ਰਹੋ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਨਿਵਾਸ ਦੇ ਮਾਰਗਾਂ ਲਈ ਕੁਝ ਹੁਨਰ, ਅਨੁਭਵ, ਯੋਗਤਾਵਾਂ ਜਾਂ ਪੇਸ਼ੇਆਂ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ। ਭਵਿੱਖ ਦੀ ਕਮਾਈ, ਘਰ ਖਰੀਦਣ, ਜਾਂ ਸਰਕਾਰੀ ਸਹਾਇਤਾ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਕਰਨ ਦੇ ਵਾਅਦੇ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਜੋ ਪੇਸ਼ਕਸ਼ ਕੀਤੀ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ ਉਸ ਦੇ ਆਧਾਰ 'ਤੇ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਇੱਥੇ ਆਉਣ ਦਾ ਫੈਸਲਾ ਕਰਨਾ ਚਾਹੀਦਾ ਹੈ, ਨਾ ਕਿ ਭਵਿੱਖ ਦੇ ਵਾਅਦਿਆਂ 'ਤੇ ਜੋ ਸ਼ਾਇਦ ਪੂਰੇ ਨਾ ਕੀਤੇ ਜਾ ਸਕਣ। ਆਮ ਤੌਰ 'ਤੇ, ਜਦੋਂ ਤੱਕ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਕੋਲ ਰਿਹਾਇਸ਼ੀ ਵੀਜ਼ਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ, ਤੁਸੀਂ ਘਰ ਨਹੀਂ ਖਰੀਦ ਸਕਦੇ ਜਾਂ ਸਰਕਾਰੀ ਵਿੱਤੀ ਸਹਾਇਤਾ ਤੱਕ ਨਹੀਂ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਸਕਦੇ। ਤੁਸੀਂ ਵਾਧੂ ਪੈਸੇ ਕਮਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਵਾਧੂ ਨੌਕਰੀਆਂ ਨਹੀਂ ਲੈ ਸਕਦੇ। ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਦੱਸਿਆ ਗਿਆ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਨੀ ਚਾਹੀਦੀ ਹੈ ਵੀਜ਼ਾ ਲਈ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਦੇਣ ਲਈ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ। ਤੁਸੀਂ ਸਾਡੀ ਵੈੱਬਸਾਈਟ 'ਤੇ ਦਿੱਤੀ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਕੇ ਆਪਣੇ ਤੌਰ 'ਤੇ ਵੀਜ਼ਾ ਲਈ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਦੇ ਸਕਦੇ ਹੋ। ਜੇਕਰ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਕਿਸੇ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਨਾ ਚੁਣਦੇ ਹੋ, ਤਾਂ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਲਾਇਸੰਸਸ਼ੁਦਾ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ (LIA), ਇੱਕ ਪ੍ਰਮਾਣਿਤ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਦੇ ਵਕੀਲ, ਜਾਂ ਕਾਨੂੰਨੀ ਤੌਰ 'ਤੇ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਸਲਾਹ ਪ੍ਰਦਾਨ ਕਰਨ ਦੇ ਯੋਗ ਕੋਈ ਹੋਰ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਵਰਤੋ। ਤੁਸੀਂ ਆਪਣੀ ਭਾਸ਼ਾ, ਸਥਾਨ ਅਤੇ ਬਜਟ ਦੇ ਆਧਾਰ 'ਤੇ LIA ਚੁਣ ਸਕਦੇ ਹੋ। ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਐਪਲੀਕੇਸ਼ਨ ਅੱਪਡੇਟ ਨਹੀਂ ਮਿਲ ਰਹੇ ਹਨ ਜੇਕਰ ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਜਾਂ ਤੀਜੀ ਧਿਰ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਤੁਹਾਡੀ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ 'ਤੇ ਕੋਈ ਅੱਪਡੇਟ ਨਹੀਂ ਦੇ ਰਹੀ ਹੈ, ਤਾਂ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਇਹ ਪਤਾ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਸਾਡੀ ਵੈੱਬਸਾਈਟ 'ਤੇ ਜਾ ਸਕਦੇ ਹੋ ਕਿ ਅਰਜ਼ੀਆਂ 'ਤੇ ਕਾਰਵਾਈ ਕਰਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਕਿੰਨਾ ਸਮਾਂ ਲੱਗਦਾ ਹੈ। ਜੇਕਰ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਚਿੰਤਤ ਹੋ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰ ਰਹੇ ਹੋ, ਤਾਂ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਦੀ ਪੁਸ਼ਟੀ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਸਾਨੂੰ ਸਿੱਧਾ ਕਾਲ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੇ ਹੋ। ਤੁਸੀਂ ਸਾਡੀਆਂ ਅਧਿਕਾਰਤ ਔਨਲਾਈਨ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰ ਰਹੇ ਹੋ ਅਸੀਂ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਦੀਆਂ ਕੁਝ ਔਨਲਾਈਨ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ ਦੀ ਨਕਲ ਕਰਨ ਵਾਲੀਆਂ ਘਪਲੇ ਵਾਲੀਆਂ ਵੈੱਬਸਾਈਟਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਜਾਣੂ ਹਾਂ। ਇਹ ਯਕੀਨੀ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਇਹਨਾਂ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ ਲਈ ਸਾਡੇ ਅਧਿਕਾਰਤ ਲਿੰਕਾਂ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰੋ ਕਿ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਨਕਲੀ ਵੈੱਬਸਾਈਟਾਂ 'ਤੇ ਜਾਣ ਲਈ ਧੋਖਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਜਾ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਤੁਸੀਂ ਇਹ ਯਕੀਨੀ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਵੈੱਬਸਾਈਟ ਪਤੇ ਦੀ ਜਾਂਚ ਕਰਕੇ ਇਸ ਦੀ ਪੁਸ਼ਟੀ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੇ ਹੋ ਕਿ ਇਸ ਵਿੱਚ ‘.immigration.govt.nz’ ਬਿਲਕੁਲ ਸ਼ਾਮਲ ਹੈ। ਧਿਆਨ ਨਾਲ ਜਾਂਚ ਕਰੋ ਕਿਉਂ ਕਿ ਘੁਟਾਲੇ ਦੀ ਵੈੱਬਸਾਈਟ ਦੇ ਪਤੇ ਸਮਾਨ ਦਿਖਾਈ ਦੇ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ। ਜੇਕਰ ਸ਼ੱਕ ਹੈ, ਤਾਂ ਸਾਡੀ ਵੈੱਬਸਾਈਟ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਸਿੱਧੇ ਸਾਡੀਆਂ ਔਨਲਾਈਨ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਕਰੋ। ਆਪਣੇ ਆਪ ਨੂੰ ਘੁਟਾਲਿਆਂ ਤੋਂ ਬਚਾਉਣ ਦੇ ਤਰੀਕੇ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਨ ਦੀ ਲੋੜ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ। ਜੇਕਰ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਕਿਸੇ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਨਾ ਚੁਣਦੇ ਹੋ, ਤਾਂ ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਲਾਇਸੰਸਸ਼ੁਦਾ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ, ਇੱਕ ਪ੍ਰਮਾਣਿਤ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਦੇ ਵਕੀਲ, ਜਾਂ ਕਾਨੂੰਨੀ ਤੌਰ 'ਤੇ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਸਲਾਹ ਪ੍ਰਦਾਨ ਕਰਨ ਦੇ ਯੋਗ ਕੋਈ ਹੋਰ ਵਿਅਕਤੀ ਵਰਤੋ। ਜੇਕਰ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਕਿਸੇ ਸਲਾਹਕਾਰ ਜਾਂ ਭਰਤੀ ਏਜੰਸੀ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਨਾ ਚੁਣਦੇ ਹੋ, ਤਾਂ ਵੱਖ-ਵੱਖ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਤੋਂ ਕੀਮਤਾਂ ਦੀ ਜਾਂਚ ਕਰਨਾ ਇੱਕ ਚੰਗਾ ਵਿਚਾਰ ਹੈ, ਤਾਂ ਜੋ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਜਾਣਦੇ ਹੋਵੋ ਕਿ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ ਲਈ ਉਚਿਤ ਕੀਮਤ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕਰ ਰਹੇ ਹੋ। ਯਕੀਨੀ ਬਣਾਓ ਕਿ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਇਮੀਗ੍ਰੇਸ਼ਨ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਦੀਆਂ ਅਧਿਕਾਰਤ ਔਨਲਾਈਨ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਕਰ ਰਹੇ ਹੋ। ਇਹ ਯਕੀਨੀ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਵੈਬਸਾਈਟ ਪਤੇ ਦੀ ਧਿਆਨ ਨਾਲ ਜਾਂਚ ਕਰੋ ਕਿ ਇਸ ਵਿੱਚ ‘.immigration.govt.nz’ ਬਿਲਕੁਲ ਸ਼ਾਮਲ ਹੈ ਜਾਂ ਸਾਡੀ ਵੈੱਬਸਾਈਟ ਰਾਹੀਂ ਸਾਡੀਆਂ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਕਰੋ। ਪੁਸ਼ਟੀ ਕਰੋ ਕਿ ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਸੰਭਾਵੀ ਮਾਲਕ ਮਾਨਤਾ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਹੈ। ਇੱਕ ਮਾਨਤਾ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਰੁਜ਼ਗਾਰਦਾਤਾ ਵਰਕ ਵੀਜ਼ਾ 'ਤੇ ਕਰਮਚਾਰੀਆਂ ਦੀ ਭਰਤੀ ਕਰਨ ਵਾਲੇ ਸਾਰੇ ਮਾਲਕ ਪਹਿਲਾਂ ਮਾਨਤਾ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਹੋਣੇ ਚਾਹੀਦੇ ਹਨ। ਪੁਸ਼ਟੀ ਕਰੋ ਕਿ ਉਹ ਸਾਡੇ ਔਨਲਾਈਨ ਟੂਲ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰ ਰਹੇ ਹਨ। ਆਪਣੇ ਸੰਭਾਵੀ ਮਾਲਕ ਨਾਲ ਸਿੱਧੀ ਗੱਲ ਕਰੋ, ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕਿ ਇੰਟਰਵਿਊ ਰਾਹੀਂ। ਦੂਜੇ ਦੇਸ਼ਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਜਾਣਾ ਇੱਕ ਵੱਡੀ ਵਚਨਬੱਧਤਾ ਹੈ, ਇਸ ਲਈ ਇਹ ਯਕੀਨੀ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਕਿ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਇੱਕ ਚੰਗੇ ਪਾਤਰ ਹੋ, ਆਪਣੇ ਹੁਨਰਾਂ ਬਾਰੇ ਇਮਾਨਦਾਰ ਰਹੋ। ਜੇ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਕੋਈ ਸ਼ੱਕ ਹੈ, ਤਾਂ ਸਾਡੇ ਨਾਲ ਸੰਪਰਕ ਕਰੋ। ਅਸੀਂ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਵੀਜ਼ਾ ਵਿਕਲਪਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਮਝਾਉਣ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਦਦ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਕੀ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਕਿਸੇ ਦੁਆਰਾ ਦੱਸੀ ਗਈ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਸਹੀ ਜਾਂ ਵਾਸਤਵਿਕ ਹੈ। ਅਸੀਂ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਤੁਹਾਡੀ ਅਰਜ਼ੀ ਬਾਰੇ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਪ੍ਰਦਾਨ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਾਂ। ਜੇਕਰ ਅੰਗਰੇਜ਼ੀ ਤੁਹਾਡੀ ਪਹਿਲੀ ਭਾਸ਼ਾ ਨਹੀਂ ਹੈ, ਤਾਂ ਅਸੀਂ ਤੁਹਾਨੂੰ ਦੁਭਾਸ਼ੀਏ ਨਾਲ ਜੋੜ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਾਂ। ਜੇ ਤੁਸੀਂ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੇ ਹੋ, ਤਾਂ ਆਪਣੇ ਦੇਸ਼ ਦੇ ਉਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਲੋਕਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਪੁੱਛ ਕੇ ਹੋਰ ਖੋਜ ਕਰੋ ਜਿਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੇ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਦੀ ਇਹੀ ਯਾਤਰਾ ਕੀਤੀ ਹੈ। ਜੇਕਰ ਤੁਹਾਡਾ ਮਾਲਕ ਰਿਹਾਇਸ਼ ਪ੍ਰਦਾਨ ਕਰ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ, ਤਾਂ ਫੋਟੋਆਂ ਮੰਗੋ ਅਤੇ ਕਿਰਾਏਦਾਰੀ ਸੇਵਾਵਾਂ ਦੀ ਵੈੱਬਸਾਈਟ 'ਤੇ ਜਾਓ ਅਤੇ ਉਸ ਖੇਤਰ ਵਿੱਚ ਜਾਇਦਾਦ ਦੀ ਕਿਸਮ ਲਈ ਬਾਜ਼ਾਰ ਦੇ ਕਿਰਾਏ ਦੀ ਤੁਲਨਾ ਕਰੋ ਅਤੇ ਕਿਰਾਏਦਾਰ ਵਜੋਂ ਆਪਣੇ ਅਧਿਕਾਰਾਂ ਬਾਰੇ ਜਾਣੋ। ਰਹਿਣ-ਸਹਿਣ ਦੀ ਲਾਗਤ ਅਤੇ ਸਿਹਤ ਸੰਭਾਲ ਤੱਕ ਪਹੁੰਚ ਸਮੇਤ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਬਾਰੇ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਪ੍ਰਾਪਤ ਕਰੋ। ਸਾਡੀ ਲਿਵ ਐਂਡ ਵਰਕ ਵੈੱਬਸਾਈਟ ਵਿੱਚ ਉਪਯੋਗੀ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਹੈ। ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਵਰਕਰ ਵਜੋਂ ਆਪਣੇ ਰੁਜ਼ਗਾਰ ਅਧਿਕਾਰਾਂ ਬਾਰੇ ਜਾਣੋ। ਰੋਜ਼ਗਾਰ ਨਿਊਜ਼ੀਲੈਂਡ ਦੀ ਵੈੱਬਸਾਈਟ 'ਤੇ ਕਈ ਭਾਸ਼ਾਵਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਦਦਗਾਰ ਜਾਣਕਾਰੀ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਘੱਟੋ-ਘੱਟ ਅਧਿਕਾਰਾਂ, ਜ਼ਿੰਮੇਵਾਰੀਆਂ ਅਤੇ ਰੁਜ਼ਗਾਰ ਦੀਆਂ ਸਮੱਸਿਆਵਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਹੱਲ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਇੱਕ ਮੁਫ਼ਤ ਸਿਖਲਾਈ ਮੋਡੀਊਲ ਹੈ।"

        "main_content": "Kung ikaw ay nagpaplanong kumuha ng visa para makapunta sa New Zealand, mag-ingat sa mga tao na maaaring mag-scam sa iyo para nakawin ang iyong pera o magpa-sign up sa iyo sa mga trabaho na iba sa ipinangako nila. Ang nasa ibaba ay mga scam na dapat bantayan at mga hakbang na maaari mong gawin upang protektahan ang iyong sarili laban sa mga scam o pagdaraya sa visa. Kung ikaw ay nagtatrabaho na sa New Zealand, at sa palagay mo ay pinagsasamantalahan ka , huwag matakot humingi ng tulong sa Immigration New Zealand (INZ). Kami at ang Employment New Zealand ay maaaring makatulong sa iyo, at gumawa ng aksyon kung kailangan. Bantayan ang mga palatandaan ng isang scam Kapag nakakita ka ng mga palatandaang ito ng isang scam, tumigil at gumawa ng mga karagdagang pag-iingat. Magtanong at humingi ng opisyal na payo. Maaari kang makipag-usap sa amin tungkol sa iyong mga alalahanin. Hihilinging magbayad ka para sa iyong trabaho Mag-ingat kapag hinilingan kang magbayad ng mga kabayaran para sa iyong trabaho, kung minsan ay tinatawag na mga kabayaran para sa 'pagproseso' o 'placement' (pagpupuwesto). Hindi ka maaaring singilin ng mga tagapag-empleyo sa New Zealand ng mga kabayaran para sa isang trabaho o pagbayarin ka ng anumang mga gastusin nila sa pag-recruit. Kabilang dito ang hindi direkta o sa pamamagitan ng ikatlong partido na sapilitang hihilingan kang magbayad sa kanila. Kung ikaw ay gumagamit ng: isang recruitment agency, mag-ingat sa anumang mataas na kabayaran na gusto nilang direktang singilin sa iyo. Anumang mga singil mula sa isang recruitment agency ay dapat naayon sa kanilang ibinibigay na serbisyo sa iyo. isang tagapayong pang-imigrasyon, kailangan mong magbayad ng makatarungang presyo para sa kanyang mga serbisyo. Ang Immigration New Zealand ay sisingil lamang sa iyo ng bayad para sa aplikasyon. Maaaring kailangan mong bayaran ang gastos sa pangangalap ng ebidensya para sa iyong aplikasyon, gaya ng pagkumpleto ng medikal. Pagkuha ng prayoridad para sa aplikasyon at pag-access sa mga opisyal ng imigrasyon Sa scam na ito, sasabihin ng iyong tagapayo, ahente, consultant o iba pang ikatlong partido na magagamit nila ang kanilang mga koneksyon para magarantiyahan ang kalalabasan o mas mabilis na desisyon. Hindi mo kailangang gumamit ng tagapayo. Immigration New Zealand: hindi uunahin ang iyong aplikasyon dahil gumamit ka ng tagapayo, at dedesisyunan lamang ang mga aplikasyon sa pamamagitan ng pagtasa sa impormasyong nakasaad dito kung naaayon sa mga tuntunin ng imigrasyon. Pagkuha ng prayoridad para sa aplikasyon at pag-access sa mga opisyal ng imigrasyon Sa scam na ito, laging sinasabi ng iyong tagapayo, ahente, consultant o iba pang ikatlong partido na mayroon silang kaalamang galing sa loob (insider information) o access sa mga opisyal ng imigrasyon para unahin ang iyong aplikasyon. Hindi mo kailangang gumamit ng tagapayo. Hindi uunahin ng Immigration New Zealand ang iyong aplikasyon kung gagamit ka ng tagapayo. Ang mga tagapayo ay tutulong lamang sa iyo na maunawaan ang sistema ng imigrasyon. Hihilinging magsinungaling ka Labag sa batas ang magsinungaling para maging kwalipikado para sa isang trabaho o visa. Lumalabag sa batas ang iyong tagapayo o iba pang ikatlong partido kung papayuhan ka nilang gawin ito. Palatandaan ito na maaaring labagin nila ang iba pang mga batas ng imigrasyon o pagtatrabaho. Mahalaga na ang impormasyong iyong ibibigay ay totoo. Anumang hindi totoong mga pahayag na gagawin mo ay makakaapekto sa iyong mga aplikasyon para sa visa sa kasalukuyan at sa hinaharap. Sinabihan ka na wala kang mga minimum na karapatan sa pagtatrabaho na kapareho ng sa isang taga-New Zealand Hindi ito totoo. Lahat sa New Zealand ay may kaparehong minimum na mga karapatan sa pagtatrabaho, kabilang ang mga migrante. Kabilang dito ang karapatan sa may-bayad na bakasyon at sick leave, at ang karapatang ireklamo ang mga hindi ligtas na mga gawi sa trabaho. Ang mga taong nagsasabi na wala ka ng mga ito ay maaaring lumalabag sa mga batas ng imigrasyon o pagtatrabaho. Aalukin ka ng package deal sa akomodasyon Hindi pangkaraniwan na mayroong nakalaang akomodasyon ang isang trabaho sa New Zealand. Sa ilang mga sitwasyon lamang nagiging malinaw ito, katulad ng pagtatrabaho sa isang farm o para sa isang tagapagbigay ng akomodasyon. Mag-ingat sa mga 'package' na alok na may visa, trabaho at akomodasyon – maaaring tangkain ng mga scammer na singilin ka ng labis-labis na halaga para sa akomodasyon. Ikaw ay pinangakuan ng residensya Nagbibigay ang New Zealand ng magaling na mga oportunidad upang mag-aral at magtrabaho. Ang pansamantalang visa ay pahihintulutan kang tamasahin ang mga oportunidad na ito, ngunit walang garantiya na hahantong ito sa pagkakaroon ng residensya. Madalas magsabi nang labis-labis ang mga scammer sa posibilidad na magkaroon ng residensya, kaya mag-ingat dahil ang mga landasin tungo sa pagkakaroon ng residensya ay nangangailangan ng partikular na mga kasanayan, karanasan, kwalipikasyon o trabaho. Mga pangako sa kikitain sa hinaharap, pagbili ng bahay, o pag-access sa suporta ng pamahalaan Dapat kang magpasya na lumipat dito batay sa iniaalok sa iyo, hindi sa mga pangako sa hinaharap na maaaring hindi matupad. Karaniwan, hindi ka makakabili ng bahay o maka-access sa suportang pinansyal ng pamahalaan maliban kung ikaw ay may hawak na residence visa. Hindi ka maaaring magkaroon ng karagdagang trabaho para kumita ng karagdagang pera. Ikaw ay sinabihan na dapat kang gumamit ng tagapayo Hindi mo kailangang gumamit ng tagapayo para mag-aplay para sa visa. Maaaring ikaw mismo ang mag-aplay para sa visa gamit ang impormasyon sa aming website. Kung pipiliin mong gumamit ng tagapayo, gumamit lamang ng isang lisensyado na pang-imigrasyong tagapayo (licensed immigration adviser - LIA), isang sertipikadong abogado sa New Zealand, o isang taong may ligal na kakayahang magbigay ng pang-imigrasyong payo. Maaari kang pumili ng mga LIA batay sa iyong wika, lokasyon at badyet. Hindi ka nakakakuha ng mga update sa aplikasyon Kung ang iyong tagapayo o ikatlong partido ay hindi nagbibigay sa iyo ng update, maaari kang pumunta sa aming website upang alamin kung gaano katagal ang pagproseso ng mga aplikasyon. Kung ikaw ay nag-aalala dahil hindi ka tumatanggap ng impormasyon, maaari mo kaming tawagan nang direkta para beripikahin ang aplikasyon. Hindi mo ina-access ang aming opisyal na mga serbisyo sa online Alam namin na may mga scam na website na nagpapanggap na ilan sa mga serbisyo sa online ng Immigration New Zealand. Gamitin ang aming mga opisyal na link sa mga serbisyong ito upang matiyak na hindi ka malolokong bumisita sa mga pekeng website. Maaari mong kumpirmahin ito sa pamamagitan ng pagtingin sa website address para tiyaking mayroon ito ng eksaktong ‘.immigration.govt.nz’. Tingnan itong mabuti dahil ang mga scam na website ay mukhang magkapareho. Kung may pagdududa, maa-access mo nang direkta ang aming mga serbisyo sa online sa pamamagitan ng aming website. Mga paraan sa pagprotekta ng iyong sarili laban sa mga scam Hindi mo kailangang gumamit ng tagapayo. Kung pipiliin mong gumamit ng tagapayo, gumamit lamang ng isang lisensyado na pang-imigrasyong tagapayo, isang sertipikadong abogado sa New Zealand, o isang tao na may ligal na kakayahang magbigay ng pang-imigrasyong payo. Kung pipiliin mong gumamit ng tagapayo o recruitment agency, magandang ideya na tingnan ang mga presyo ng iba, para alam mong tumatanggap ka ng makatarungang presyo para sa kanilang mga serbisyo. Tiyaking ina-access mo ang opisyal na mga serbisyo sa online ng Immigration New Zealand. Tingnang mabuti ang website address para matiyak na mayroon ito ng eksaktong ‘.immigration.govt.nz’ o i-access ang aming mga serbisyo sa pamamagitan ng aming website. Kumpirmahin na akreditado ang iyong potensyal na tagapag-empleyo. Lahat ng mga tagapag-empleyo na kumukuha ng mga manggagawa sa ilalim ng Accredited Employer Work Visa ay dapat munang maging akreditado. Kumpirmahing ginagamit nila ang aming online tool. Makipag-usap nang direkta sa iyong potensyal na tagapag-empleyo, gaya halimbawa, sa pamamagitan ng isang interbyu. Ang paglipat sa ibang bansa ay isang malaking pagpapasya, kaya maging tapat tungkol sa iyong mga kasanayan upang matiyak na angkop ka sa trabaho. Kung ikaw ay may mga pagdududa, makipag-ugnay sa amin. Maaari naming ipaliwanag ang iyong mga opsyon sa visa at kung ang sinabing impormasyon sa iyo ng isang tao ay tama o totoo. Maaari ka naming bigyan ng impormasyon tungkol sa iyong aplikasyon. Kung ang iyong unang wika ay hindi Ingles, maaari ka naming ikonekta sa isang interpreter. Kung kaya mo, gumawa ka ng karagdagang pananaliksik sa pamamagitan ng pagtatanong sa mga tao mula sa iyong bansa na nakapaglakbay na sa New Zealand para sa kaparehong dahilan. Kung ang iyong tagapag-empleyo ay naglalaan ng akomodasyon, humingi ng mga litrato at pumunta sa website ng Tenancy Services at magkumpara ng mga upa sa merkado para sa uri ng propyedad sa lugar na iyon at alamin ang iyong mga karapatan bilang isang nangungupahan. Magkaroon ng kaalaman tungkol sa New Zealand, kabilang ang halaga ng pamumuhay at pagkuha ng pangkalusugang pangangalaga. Ang aming Live and Work website ay may makakatulong na impormasyon. Alamin ang iyong mga karapatan sa pagtatrabaho bilang isang manggagawa sa New Zealand. Ang website ng Employment New Zealand ay may makakatulong na impormasyon sa ilang mga wika, at isang libreng learning module tungkol sa mga minimum na karapatan, responsibilidad at pag-aayos ng mga problema sa trabaho."

Chúng tôi (INZ) và Cơ quan Việc làm New Zealand (Employment New Zealand) có thể giúp bạn, và ra tay hành động nếu cần. Kiểm tra các dấu hiệu lừa đảo Nếu bạn thấy những dấu hiệu lừa đảo này, hãy dừng lại và cảnh giác cao độ. Đặt câu hỏi và tìm kiếm thông tin chính thức. Bạn có thể nói chuyện với chúng tôi về các quan ngại của bạn. Bạn được yêu cầu trả tiền để có được công việc của bạn Hãy cẩn thận nếu bạn được yêu cầu trả tiền, trả phí để có được công việc của bạn, đôi khi được gọi là phí 'xử lý' hoặc phí 'sắp xếp' việc làm. Chủ lao động ở New Zealand không được yêu cầu bạn trả phí, trả tiền để bạn có việc làm, và không được bắt bạn phải trả các chi phí tuyển dụng của họ. Không được đòi tiền bạn gián tiếp thông qua một bên thứ ba, không kêu bên thứ ba lấy tiền của bạn. Nếu bạn đang sử dụng: trung gian, môi giới tuyển dụng, thì hãy cảnh giác với các khoản phí cao mà họ muốn thu trực tiếp của bạn. Bất kỳ khoản phí nào mà môi giới thu của bạn phải phản ánh đúng, tương ứng với các dịch vụ mà họ cung cấp cho bạn. chuyên viên tư vấn di trú (immigration adviser), thì bạn sẽ phải trả một mức phí hợp lý cho các dịch vụ của họ. Sở Di trú New Zealand chỉ thu của bạn lệ phí nộp đơn xin visa. Bạn có thể cần phải trả các chi phí trong quá trình tập hợp bằng chứng, giấy tờ đính kèm với đơn xin visa của bạn, chẳng hạn như phí khám sức khỏe để xin visa.

Bạn không nhất thiết phải sử dụng, phải thuê chuyên viên tư vấn di trú. Sở Di trú New Zealand không ưu tiên xét đơn xin visa của bạn vì bạn có thuê chuyên viên tư vấn di trú. Chuyên viên tư vấn di trú chỉ giúp bạn hiểu biết về hệ thống nhập cư. Bạn được xúi nói dối Việc nói dối để đáp ứng các yêu cầu của công việc, để xin được thị thực là hành vi bất hợp pháp. Chuyên viên tư vấn di trú của bạn hoặc các bên thứ ba khác đang vi phạm pháp luật nếu họ khuyên bạn làm như vậy. Đó là một dấu hiệu cho thấy họ có thể đang vi phạm những luật pháp khác về nhập cư và lao động. Điều quan trọng là thông tin bạn cung cấp là đúng sự thật. Bất kỳ thông tin gian dối nào bạn đưa ra sẽ ảnh hưởng đến các đơn xin thị thực hiện tại và tương lai của bạn. Bạn được cho biết là bạn không có các quyền tối thiểu của người lao động giống với người New Zealand Điều này không đúng. Mọi người lao động ở New Zealand đều có các quyền tối thiểu như nhau, bao gồm cả người nhập cư. Bao gồm quyền được nghỉ phép và nghỉ ốm có lương, và quyền khiếu nại về môi trường làm việc không an toàn. Người nào nói với bạn rằng lao động nhập cư không có các quyền này, thì người đó có thể là đang vi phạm luật nhập cư, luật lao động. Bạn được cung cấp thỏa thuận trọn gói bao gồm chỗ ở Việc cung cấp chỗ ở đi kèm với việc làm ở New Zealand không phải là điều phổ biến. Chỉ trong một số trường hợp, chẳng hạn như làm việc trong trang trại hoặc trong khách sạn, nhà nghỉ, thì thỏa thuận trọn gói mới hợp lý. Hãy cảnh giác với những lời chào mời 'trọn gói' bao gồm thị thực, việc làm và chỗ ở – những kẻ lừa đảo có thể đang tìm cách thu của bạn rất nhiều tiền chỗ ở. Bạn được hứa hẹn định cư lâu dài, vĩnh viễn New Zealand mang đến những cơ hội tuyệt vời để học tập và làm việc. Thị thực tạm thời giúp bạn tận hưởng những cơ hội này, nhưng không có gì đảm bảo sau đó bạn sẽ được định cư vĩnh viễn. Những kẻ lừa đảo thường thổi phồng khả năng bạn sẽ được cấp quyền cư trú vĩnh viễn, vì vậy hãy lưu ý, bởi vì con đường dẫn đến định cư vĩnh viễn đòi hỏi bạn phải có một số kỹ năng, kinh nghiệm, bằng cấp, và nghề nghiệp nhất định. Hứa hẹn thu nhập trong tương lai, mua nhà và hưởng các hỗ trợ của chính phủ Bạn nên quyết định việc di chuyển đến NZ dựa trên những gì bạn đã thỏa thuận được, không phải dựa trên những lời hứa về tương lai vốn có thể không xảy ra.

دھوکہ باز آپ سے رہائش کے لئے ضرورت سے زیادہ رقم وصول کرنے کی کوشش کرسکتے ہیں۔ آپ سے مستقل رہائشی ویزے کا وعدہ کیا گیا ہے نیوزی لینڈ تعلیم حاصل کرنے اور کام کرنے کے شاندار مواقع فراہم کرتا ہے. ایک عارضی ویزا آپ کو ان مواقع سے لطف اندوز کرنے کی اجازت دے گا، لیکن اس بات کی کوئی ضمانت نہیں ہے کہ اس کے بعد آپ کو مستقل رہائشی ویزہ ملے گا۔ دھوکہ باز اکثر مسقتل رہائشی ویزے کے امکان کو بڑھا چڑھا کر بتاتے ہيں، لہذا چوکنے رہیں کیونکہ مستقل رہائشی ویزے کو حاصل کرنے کے لیے کچھ مہارتوں ، تجربے ، قابلیت یا خاص پیشوں کی ضرورت ہوتی ہے۔ مستقبل کی کمائی، گھر خریدنے، یا سرکاری امداد تک رسائی کے وعدے آپ کو یہاں آنے کا فیصلہ اس بات کی بنیاد پر کرنا چاہئے کہ آپ کو کیا اس وقت کیا پیشکش کی جا رہی ہے، نہ کہ مستقبل کے وعدوں کی بنیاد پر جو ہو سکتا ہے پورے نہ کیے جا سکیں۔ عام طور پر، آپ اس وقت تک گھر نہیں خرید سکتے یا حکومت کی مالی مدد تک رسائی حاصل نہیں کرسکتے ہیں جب تک کہ آپ کے پاس مستقل رہائشی ویزا نہ ہو۔ آپ اضافی پیسہ کمانے کے لئے اضافی ملازمتیں نہيں کر سکتے. آپ کو بتایا جاتا ہے کہ آپ کو لازمی طور پر ایک ایڈوائزر کی خدمات حاصل کرنی ہيں آپ کو ویزے کی درخواست دینے کے لیے ایڈوائزر استعمال کرنے کی ضرورت نہیں ہے. آپ ہماری ویب سائٹ پر موجود معلومات استعمال کرتے ہوئے خود اپنے طور پر ہی ویزے کے لئے درخواست دے سکتے ہیں. اگر آپ کسی ایڈوائزر کو استعمال کرنے کا انتخاب کرتے ہیں تو صرف ایک لائسنس یافتہ امیگریشن ایڈوائزر (LIA) ، نیوزی لینڈ میں تصدیق شدہ وکیل، یا کسی ایسے شخص کا انتخاب کریں جو قانونی طور پر امیگریشن سے متعلق مشورہ فراہم کرنے کا اہل ہو آپ اپنی زبان ، مقام اور بجٹ کی بنیاد پر LIA منتخب کرسکتے ہیں۔ آپ کو اپنی درخواست پر کارروائی کی اپ ڈیٹس نہیں مل رہیں اگر آپ کا ایڈوائزر یا تیسرا فریق آپ کو آپ کی درخواست پر اپ ڈیٹ نہیں دے رہا تو آپ یہ معلوم کرنے کے لئے ہماری ویب سائٹ پر جاسکتے ہیں کہ درخواستوں پر کارروائی میں کتنا وقت لگتا ہے۔ اگر اس لیے آپ فکر مند ہیں کیونکہ آپ کو معلومات نہیں مل رہیں تو آپ درخواست کی تصدیق کرنے کے لئے براہ راست ہمیں کال کر سکتے ہیں. آپ ہماری سرکاری آن لائن خدمات حاصل نہیں کر رہے ہم امیگریشن نیوزی لینڈ کی کچھ آن لائن خدمات کی نقل کرنے والی فریبی ویب سائٹس سے واقف ہیں۔ ان خدمات کے لئے ہمارے سرکاری لنکس استعمال کریں تاکہ آپ دھوکے سے جعلی ویب سائٹوں پر جانے سے بچ سکیں۔ آپ تصدیق کے لیے ویب سائٹ کا پتہ چیک کر کے یہ یقینی بنا سکتے ہيں کہ اس میں ’.immigration.govt.nz.‘ ہوبہو شامل ہے۔ احتیاط سے چیک کریں کیونکہ فریبی ویب سائٹوں کے پتے اس سے ملتے جلتے نظر آسکتے ہیں۔ اگر شک ہو تو، ہماری ویب سائٹ کے ذریعے براہ راست ہماری آن لائن خدمات تک رسائی حاصل کریں. دھوکہ دہی سے اپنے آپ کو بچانے کے طریقے آپ کو ایڈوائزر استعمال کرنے کی ضرورت نہیں ہے. اگر آپ کسی ایڈوائزر کو استعمال کرنے کا انتخاب کرتے ہیں تو صرف ایک لائسنس یافتہ امیگریشن ایڈوائزر، نیوزی لینڈ میں تصدیق شدہ وکیل، یا کسی ایسے شخص کا انتخاب کریں جو قانونی طور پر امیگریشن سے متعلق مشورہ فراہم کرنے کا اہل ہو اگر آپ ایک ایڈوائزر یا ریکروٹمنٹ ایجنسی استعمال کرنے کا انتخاب کرتے ہیں تو مختلف ایڈوائزروں یا ایجنسیوں سے قیمتوں کی جانچ پڑتال کر لینا ایک اچھا خیال ہے، تاکہ آپ جانتے ہوں کہ آپ ان کی خدمات کے لئے مناسب قیمت ادا کر رہے ہیں۔ یقینی بنائیں کہ آپ امیگریشن نیوزی لینڈ کی سرکاری آن لائن خدمات تک رسائی حاصل کر رہے ہیں۔ ویب سائٹ کے ایڈریس کو احتیاط سے چیک کر کے یہ یقینی بنائيں کہ اس میں ’.immigration.govt.nz‘ ہوبہو شامل ہے یا پھر ہماری ویب سائٹ کے ذریعے ہماری خدمات تک رسائی حاصل کریں۔ تصدیق کرلیں کہ آپ کا ممکنہ آجر تسلیم شدہ ہے۔ منظور شدہ آجر ورک ویزا (Accredited Employer Work Visa) پر کارکنوں کو بھرتی کرنے والے تمام آجروں کا پہلے تسلیم شدہ ہونا ضروری ہے۔ تصدیق کریں کہ وہ ہمارا آن لائن ٹول استعمال کر رہے ہیں. اپنے ممکنہ آجر سے براہ راست بات کریں ، جیسے انٹرویو۔ دوسرے ممالک منتقل ہونا ایک بڑا عزم ہے ، لہذا اپنی مہارتوں کے بارے میں ایمانداری سے کام لیں تاکہ اس بات کو یقینی بنانے جا سکے کہ آپ ایک موزوں شخص ہیں۔ اگر آپ کو شک ہے تو ہم سے رابطہ کریں. ہم آپ کے لیے دستیاب ویزے کی صورتوں کی وضاحت کرنے میں مدد کرسکتے ہیں اور آپ کو بتا سکتے ہیں کہ آیا آپ کو کسی کی طرف سے بتائی گئی معلومات درست یا حقیقت پسندانہ ہیں۔ ہم آپ کو آپ کی درخواست کے بارے میں معلومات فراہم کر سکتے ہیں. اگر انگلش آپ کی پہلی زبان نہیں ہے تو ہم آپ کو ایک زبانی مترجم فراہم کر سکتے ہیں. اگر ہو سکے تو اپنے ملک سے تعلق رکھنے والے ان لوگوں سے پوچھ کر مزید تحقیق کریں جنہوں نے نیوزی لینڈ کا یہی سفر اختیار کیا تھا۔ اگر آپ کا آجر رہائش فراہم کر رہا ہے تو تصاویر طلب کریں اور Tenancy Services کی ویب سائٹ پر جائیں اور اس علاقے میں اس قسم کی پراپرٹی کے مارکیٹ کرایوں کا موازنہ کریں اور کرایہ دار کی حیثیت سے اپنے حقوق کے بارے میں معلومات حاصل کریں۔ نیوزی لینڈ کے بارے میں جانیں، بشمول یہاں رہنے کے اخراجات اور صحت کی دیکھ بھال تک رسائی۔ ہماری Live and Work ویب سائٹ پر مفید معلومات موجود ہیں. نیوزی لینڈ میں کارکن کی حیثیت سے اپنے ملازمت کے حقوق کے بارے میں جانیں۔ ایمپلائمنٹ نیوزی لینڈ کی ویب سائٹ پرمتعدد زبانوں میں معاونتی معلومات دستیاب ہیں، اس کے ساتھ ساتھ کم از کم حقوق ، ذمہ داریوں اور ملازمت کے مسائل حل کرنے کے بارے میں ایک مفت لرننگ ماڈیول موجود ہے۔"

स्कैमर्स (धोखाधड़ी करने वाले लोग) आपसे आवास के लिए बहुत ज्यादा मात्रा में शुल्क लेने का प्रयास कर सकते हैं। आपसे आवास देने का वादा किया जाता है। न्यूज़ीलैंड शिक्षा और काम करने के शानदार अवसर प्रदान करता है। एक अस्थायी वीसा आपको इन अवसरों का आनंद लेने की अनुमति देगा, लेकिन इसकी कोई गारंटी नहीं है कि इससे आपको रेजिडेंस (निवास) मिलेगा। स्कैमर्स अक्सर निवास मिलने की संभावना को बढ़ा-चढ़ाकर बताते हैं, इसलिए सावधान रहें क्योंकि निवास के रास्ते के लिए कुछ कौशल, अनुभव, योग्यता या व्यवसाय की आवश्यकता होती है। भावी कमाई, घर खरीदने या सरकारी सहायता प्राप्त करने का वादा आपको यहां आने का निर्णय इस आधार पर करना चाहिए कि आपको क्या पेशकश की गई है, न कि भविष्य के लिए किए गए वादों के आधार पर जिन्हें पूरा नहीं किया जा सकता है। सामान्य तौर पर, जब तक आपके पास निवास वीसा न हो, आप घर नहीं खरीद सकते या सरकारी वित्तीय सहायता प्राप्त नहीं कर सकते। आप अतिरिक्त पैसा कमाने के लिए अतिरिक्त नौकरियाँ नहीं कर सकते। आपको बताया जाता है कि आपको एक सलाहकार का उपयोग करना चाहिए। आपको वीसा के आवेदन के लिए सलाहकार का उपयोग करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है। आप हमारी वेबसाइट पर दी गई जानकारी का उपयोग करके स्वयं वीसा के लिए आवेदन कर सकते हैं। यदि आप एक सलाहकार का उपयोग करने का चुनाव करते हैं, तो केवल एक लाइसेंस प्राप्त इमीग्रेशन एडवाइज़र (एलआईए), एक प्रमाणित न्यूज़ीलैंड वकील, या किसी ऐसे अन्य व्यक्ति का उपयोग करें जो इमीग्रेशन सलाह प्रदान करने में कानूनी रूप से सक्षम हो। आप अपनी भाषा, स्थान और बजट के आधार पर LIA (एलआईए) चुन सकते हैं। आपको एप्लिकेशन अपडेट (आवेदन अपडेट) नहीं मिल रहे हैं अगर आपका सलाहकार या तीसरा पक्ष आपको आपके आवेदन पर अपडेट नहीं दे रहा है, तो आप हमारी वेबसाइट पर जाकर पता लगा सकते हैं कि आवेदन के प्रोसेस (संसाधित) होने में कितना समय लगता है। यदि आप इस बारे में चिंतित हैं कि आपको जानकारी नहीं मिल रही है, तो आप आवेदन को सत्यापित करने के लिए सीधे हमें फोन कर सकते हैं। आप हमारी ऑफिशियल (आधिकारिक) ऑनलाइन सेवाओं का उपयोग नहीं कर रहे हैं हमें कुछ ऐसी धोखाधड़ी (स्कैम) वाली वेबसाइटों की जानकारी है जो इमिग्रेशन न्यूज़ीलैंड की कुछ ऑनलाइन सेवाओं का दिखावा करती हैं। इन सेवाओं के लिए हमारे ऑफिशियल (आधिकारिक) लिंक का उपयोग करें ताकि आपको नकली वेबसाइटों पर जाने के लिए धोखा न दिया जा सके। आप ऐसा इस बात की पुष्टि करके कर सकते हैं कि वेबसाइट के पते में ‘.immigration.govt.nz’ बिल्कुल इसी तरह लिखा हो। गौर से जाँच करें क्योंकि स्कैम वेबसाइट के पते [असली के] समान दिख सकते हैं। यदि कोई संदेह हो तो हमारी ऑनलाइन सेवाओं तक पहुँच सीधे हमारी वेबसाइट के माध्यम से करें। घोटालों से खुद को बचाने के तरीके आपको एक एडवाइज़र (सलाहकार) का उपयोग करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है। यदि आप एक सलाहकार का उपयोग करने का चुनाव करते हैं, तो केवल एक लाइसेंस प्राप्त इमीग्रेशन एडवाइज़र, एक प्रमाणित न्यूज़ीलैंड वकील, या किसी ऐसे अन्य व्यक्ति का उपयोग करें जो इमीग्रेशन सलाह प्रदान करने में कानूनी रूप से सक्षम हो। यदि आप किसी सलाहकार या भर्ती एजेंसी का उपयोग करने का चुनाव करते हैं, तो विभिन्न एजेंसियों से लागतों की जाँच करना एक अच्छा विचार है, ताकि आप जान सकें कि उनकी सेवाओं के लिए आप उचित मूल्य दे रहे है। यह सुनिश्चित करें कि आप इमिग्रेशन न्यूज़ीलैंड की आधिकारिक ऑनलाइन सेवाओं का ही उपयोग कर रहे हैं। गौर से जाँच करें कि वेबसाइट के पते में ‘.immigration.govt.nz’ बिल्कुल इसी तरह से लिखा हो, अन्यथा हमारी सेवाओं तक पहुँच सीधे हमारी वेबसाइट के माध्यम से करें। पुष्टि करें कि आपका संभावित नियोक्ता मान्यता प्राप्त है। Accredited Employer Work Visa (मान्यता प्राप्त नियोक्ता कार्य वीसा) पर कर्मचारियों को काम पर रखने वाले सभी नियोक्ताओं को पहले मान्यता प्राप्त होनी चाहिए। पुष्टि करें कि वे हमारे ऑनलाइन टूल का उपयोग कर रहे हैं। अपने संभावित नियोक्ता से सीधे बात करें, जैसे कि इंटरव्यू (साक्षात्कार) के माध्यम से। देश बदलना एक बड़ी वचनबद्धता है, इसलिए यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए कि आप इसके लिए उपयुक्त हैं, अपने कौशल के प्रति ईमानदारी बरतें। यदि आपको कोई संदेह है तो हमें संपर्क करें। हम आपके वीसा विकल्पों को समझाने में मदद कर सकते हैं और यह भी बता सकते हैं कि किसी व्यक्ति द्वारा आपको दी गई जानकारी सटीक या यथार्थवादी है या नहीं। हम आपको आपके आवेदन के बारे में जानकारी प्रदान कर सकते हैं। यदि अंग्रेजी आपकी पहली भाषा नहीं है, तो हम आपको एक दुभाषिए से जोड़ सकते हैं। यदि आप ऐसा कर सकते हैं, तो अपने देश के उन लोगों से पूछकर आगे शोध करें जिन्होंने न्यूज़ीलैंड की इसी तरह की यात्रा की है। यदि आपका नियोक्ता आवास प्रदान कर रहा है, तो तस्वीरों की मांग करें और किरायेदारी सेवा वेबसाइट पर जाएं और उस क्षेत्र में संपत्ति के प्रकार के लिए बाजार किराए की तुलना करें और किरायेदार के रूप में अपने अधिकारों के बारे में जानें। रहने के खर्चे और स्वास्थ्य देखभाल तक पहुंच समेत न्यूज़ीलैंड के बारे में सूचित रहें। हमारी Live and Work (लिव एंड वर्क) वेबसाइट पर उपयोगी जानकारी उपलब्ध है। एक न्यूज़ीलैंड कर्मचारी के रूप में अपने रोज़गार अधिकारों के बारे में जानें। Employment New Zealand (रोज़गार न्यूज़ीलैंड) की वेबसाइट पर कई भाषाओं में उपयोगी जानकारी, तथा न्यूनतम अधिकारों, ज़िम्मेदारियों और रोज़गार समस्याओं के समाधान पर एक मुफ्त शिक्षण मॉड्यूल है।"

Applying online makes the application process easier and provides applicants more visibility over their application, allowing them to check their application progress in real-time. Chinese Group Transit Visa applications Applicants applying for Group Transit Visas for Chinese Nationals must continue using the paper application process. We will be working on an online solution for this category soon. Changes to transit requirements for Fijian nationals Fiji will be added to the Transit Visa waiver list from 4 September 2024. This allows Fijian nationals to apply for a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) instead of a Transit Visa, simplifying the application process. From this date, Fiji nationals can apply for an NZeTA to transit through New Zealand. If you already have an approved Transit Visa, it will remain valid until its expiry date even after the waiver takes effect. Transit visa waiver countries The fee for an NZeTA is NZD$23.00 for online applications or NZD$17.00 if using the free app. Most NZeTA requests are processed within 72 hours and are valid for 2 years. Fijian nationals who intend to visit, study, or work in New Zealand will still need to apply for the appropriate visa before traveling. Fijian nationals travelling from or to Fiji through Wellington or Christchurch on Fiji Airways will still need to apply for a Visitor Visa, as there are no transit facilities at Wellington or Christchurch airports.

The value that we bring to these relationships includes helping to educate airline staff on: the carrier obligations under the Immigration Act 2009 and associated regulations the documents people need to enter New Zealand types of fraud examining documents the use of the Advance Passenger Processing (APP) system. Airlines have responsibilities under New Zealand regulations, they must: provide to Immigration New Zealand (INZ) the APP information required by the Act and regulations, for anyone who intends to board an aircraft to New Zealand comply with INZ directives about allowing certain persons to board an aircraft or not provide Passenger Name Record (PNR) information to INZ make sure INZ has access to the Passenger Name Record (PNR) information make sure that anyone boarding an aircraft to travel to New Zealand holds the correct documentation, including a valid passport or identity certificate and a valid visa if required prevent anyone from leaving an aircraft other than at an Immigration Control Area (ICA) provide information to an immigration officer about anyone on an aircraft, if required. Immigration New Zealand Guide for Airlines (INZ 8166) PDF 6MB Carrier Infringement Regime Commercial airlines operating flights to New Zealand may be liable for infringement fees if they breach their immigration-related obligations. A new Guide for Airlines (INZ 8166) will be available soon for airline managers and frontline staff. It explains the border control system, why it is important to comply with immigration law, how to comply with immigration law and what happens when carriers do not meet their legal obligations. Private aircraft operators Private aircraft operators should be aware that while many aspects of the carrier infringement regime do not apply to them, they must still comply with all their obligations under the Immigration Act 2009. In particular, private aircraft operators must make sure that all people travelling to New Zealand hold the correct travel documentation. Failure to do so may lead to either an infringement notice or prosecution. Advance Passenger Screening New Zealand’s border systems provide advance passenger screening to enhance the security of New Zealand's borders and minimise disruption for genuine travellers. When you check in for your flight to New Zealand, an airline will conduct an Advance Passenger Processing (APP) check with INZ. INZ will generally give the airline clearance to bring you to New Zealand. However, you may be refused permission to board your flight to come, or return, to New Zealand if: you do not have an appropriate visa to enter New Zealand, or your visa has expired, or you are attempting to travel using a stolen or lost travel document, or your visa has not been transferred to your current/new passport or the passport being used to enter New Zealand. How we collect and use information about people flying in and out of NZ In addition, the TIETAC (New Zealand) system allows airlines to ask us about your New Zealand visa status at any time during your journey to New Zealand. TIETAC is a secure network that uses information like your travel document number, nationality and name to confirm your visa status and provide messages to carriers about whether you can travel to or transit New Zealand. TIETAC was introduced to minimise travel delays for people who have been granted eVisas. It’s a good idea to make you sure your travel documents are up-to-date and you have an appropriate and current visa before you travel. If you have any questions, contact us. Contact us Immigration Control Areas There are seven Immigration Control Areas where we carry out immigration checks on people arriving in or leaving New Zealand by air.

[Hand draws the words: “Scenario 1”, with a black marker pen on the background]. [Hand draws the words: “Positive Board Response”, with a black marker pen on the background and then draws a large green tick]. Narrator: Kia Ora. Your traveller checks in, their passport is scanned and the APP response is positive. [Hand draws a picture of a figure at a check in desk and travel documents with a black marker pen]. Narrator: The response will be 8501 Okay to board [Hand draws a box with the words 8501 OK to BRD with a black marker pen]. Narrator: or the conditional response 8519 BRD with an Outward ticket. [Hand draws a box with the words 8519 BRD with OWT with a black marker pen]. Narrator: Your system may translate these responses further however, the responses and processes you follow are the same as today. [Screen shows boxes drawn earlier with 8501 OK to BRD and 8519 BRD with OWT and hand draws a green tick next to each box]. Narrator: A positive board response means the traveller has either got an NZeTA, a visa, or is an Australian or NZ citizen. [NZeTA logo appears on screen. Hand draws a document with the word “Visa” on it with a black marker pen and a green map of New Zealand appears]. Narrator: This is great news as your passenger can now board the plane!

[Hand draws the words: “Scenario 2”, with a black marker pen on the background]. [Hand draws the words: “Negative Board Response”, with a black marker pen on the background and then draws a large circle with a diagonal line through it]. Narrator: Kia Ora. In this scenario, your traveller checks in, their passport is scanned and the APP board response is negative. [Hand draws a picture of a figure at a check in desk and travel documents with a black marker pen]. Narrator: Depending on how APP is configured for your airline, the response will be either 8525 Do Not Board NO ETA found. [Hand draws a box with the words 8525 DNB – NO ETA with a black marker pen]. Narrator: or 8520 Do Not Board Contact Immigration New Zealand. [First box zooms out and hand draws a second box with the words 8520 DNB Contact INZ with a black marker pen]. Narrator: 8525 is a new code, which is available to help airlines troubleshoot NZeTA specific issues at check in. [Hand draws a green star burst with the words New Code! in it]. Narrator: If your systems are not ready to receive the new code, you will receive the 8520 code. [First box 8520 DNB Contact INZ zooms in and hand draws a black and green arrow pointing towards the box with a marker pen]. Narrator: There are several reasons a visa-waiver traveller may receive a negative boarding response. [Hand draws a large circle with a diagonal line through it with a black marker pen]. Narrator: so you’ll need to follow a few simple troubleshooting steps. [Large circle with a diagonal line zooms out and hand draws a large circle with a question mark in it with a black marker pen]. Narrator: Once you have determined that they are a visa-waiver traveller you will need to ask if they have an NZeTA? [Hand draws the NZeTA logo then draws a green arrow that splits in two pointing away from the logo to the right with a marker pen]. Narrator: If NO, then advise the traveller to request an NZeTA immediately. [Logo and double arrow zooms out and the hand draws the word NO? with a black marker pen]. Narrator: There is a flyer available to give to travellers which explains how they can request one. [Hand draws a green document with a marker pen]. Narrator: and airlines can access this from the NZeTA Communications Toolkit page found at www.immigration.govt.nz/nzetatoolkit . [Hand draws the words www.immigration.govt.nz/nzetatoolkit with a black marker pen]. Narrator: Requesting an NZeTA is a simple process. The traveller only needs their passport, a Visa or MasterCard credit or debit card, an email address, a connected device on which to apply, and to answer a few questions. [Hand draws the NZeTA logo, then draws a picture of travel documents, a picture of the Visa and MasterCard logos, the @ symbol to represent an email address, and a picture of a mobile phone and the WiFi symbol with a marker pen]. Narrator: Once the traveller has requested their NZeTA and received notification via email or the app that the NZeTA has been issued, [Hand draws the @ symbol inside an envelope to represent receiving an email]. Narrator: you can repeat the check in process. Even if they haven’t yet received the notification it’s working checking in anyway… [Hand draws a picture of a figure at a check in desk]. Narrator: as most travellers are  likely receive an OK to Board response at this point… [Hand draws a box with the words 8501 OK TO BOARD, and a second box with the words 8519 OK TO BRD WITH OWT] Narrator: which means they can board the plane and be on their way. [Hand draws a picture of an airport with a plane taking off]. Narrator: If however, the traveller is still receiving a Do Not Board response, [Hand draws a large circle with a diagonal line through it with a black marker pen]. Narrator: the Immigration Border Operations team (IBO) will need to be contacted to provide assistance. [Hand draws a picture of a telephone with a marker pen]. Narrator: If your traveller said YES to having an NZeTA, [Screen jumps back to NZeTA logo with the split green arrow with one arrowhead pointing to the word NO? and hand draws the word YES? With a black marker pen]. Narrator: you will need to troubleshoot further to establish why the traveller received a negative boarding response. [Screen zooms in on arrow pointing to YES? and hand draws circle with a diagonal line through it]. Narrator: Reasons could include: [Hand draws a monitor screen with a black marker pen] Narrator: Their NZeTA is on another passport for example if they have dual nationality, or they may have renewed their passport since requesting the NZeTA [Hand draws a bullet point on the monitor screen and the words NZeTA ON ANOTHER PASSPORT with a black marker pen] Narrator: There could be a data entry error for example their name has been inputted incorrectly [Hand draws a second bullet point on the monitor screen and the words DATA ENTRY ERROR with a black marker pen] Narrator: There may be a mismatch between the NZeTA requested and the travel conditions for example the traveller may have indicated that they are transiting through NZ and they are not, or the traveller may have indicated they are an Australian Permanent Resident and they are not. [Hand draws a third bullet point on the monitor screen and the words MISMATCH BETWEEN NZeTA AND TRAVEL CONDITIONS with a black marker pen] Narrator: The traveller may have been refused an NZeTA [Hand draws a fourth bullet point on the monitor screen and the words REFUSED NZeTA with a black marker pen] Narrator: Or the traveller may be trying to enter New Zealand with fraudulent documents [Hand draws a fifth bullet point on the monitor screen and the words FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS with a black marker pen] Narrator: In these cases, you will need to contact IBO. [Monitor disappears and hands draws a picture of a telephone with a marker pen] Narrator: The more information you can provide to IBO (such as an NZeTA request number if the traveller has one), the faster they will be able to assist the traveller. [Telephone moves to the left of the screen and hand draws a green circle with a white i in it to symbolise information]. Narrator: Travellers may have their NZeTA request number in an email or they may have printed it out. Just as today, IBO will provide assistance and you’ll need to follow their instructions. [Hand draws a picture of a mobile phone next to the information symbol and writes the text E12345 on the mobile phone screen with a black marker pen]. Narrator: So let’s recap. [Hand draws the word RECAP with a black marker pen] Narrator: In some scenarios, you may need to call for assistance however, the majority of passengers who arrive at check in and receive a Do Not Board response just need to simply request an NZeTA using the mobile App. [Hand draws a picture of a figure at a check in desk, then writes the words REQUEST AN NZeTA, then draws a picture of a mobile phone]. Narrator: By working together, this ensures passengers can board as smoothly as possible and soon be on their way to NZ. [Hand draws a picture of an airport with a plane taking off]. [Hand draws the NZeTA logo. Music fades]."

Here are some things you can do to prepare yourself for hiring overseas candidates.",
        "main_content": "Hiring from overseas will not suit every employer It takes patience and perseverance and can be more complex, costly and time-consuming than hiring locally. When preparing to hire overseas workers, you should consider the extra costs that can be involved with hiring overseas. These may include advertising, possible overseas travel and potentially, relocation costs. This section has tips for hiring overseas workers and identifying issues and challenges that may not be part of your everyday recruitment activities. Planning the recruitment process If you are new to recruiting staff from overseas, the following pointers will help you through the process: Check that your job vacancy will meet the requirements of one of the visa categories and find out what you need to do to support a migrant’s visa application Consider which country or countries you are likely to find suitable candidates in. Take into account things like cultural differences and how well the skills and qualifications from different countries will fit into the New Zealand workplace Some countries also have rules and regulations that you may need to consider when recruiting Think of creative ways of getting the message out that could increase your reach. For example, working with or through other employers, your industry association, a recruiter or local Economic Development Agency Set realistic timeframes. Factor in time for: your normal employment processes, like advertising, evaluating CVs, interviewing and checking references visa application processing your migrant worker’s preparations for moving, which may include selling their home, gathering documents for their visa application (such as medical and police certificates) and getting occupational registration if needed. Other things to consider when planning your recruitment include: How long will it take to get someone started? Who within your staff will manage the process? What will you do if you get a huge response? \n \n Tips for inclusive recruitment You want to find the best person for the job and your business. Using effective processes for hiring migrants means you will increase your pool of candidates and maximise the chance of finding the right person. Hiring migrants brings many benefits. Diversity helps to bring a range of opinions, problem-solving skills, insights and connections to your team. This leads to higher productivity and better outcomes for your business. Diversity Works NZ (formerly the Equal Employment Opportunities Trust) publishes information about the benefits that diversity can bring to your organisation. Diversity Works NZ Advertise jobs clearly It is important to check your job advertising for slang and colloquial language. Some potentially confusing words and phrases, like ‘think outside the box’ or ‘can-do attitude’, are very common but can be a barrier to understanding for many newcomers. These phrases add little to the description of the role or the competencies required. Write a clear, realistic and specific job description that candidates you want to target will understand. Include key details that will be understood, such as the nature of the role, leave provisions, salary and a clear job title. Migrants will also be interested to know whether you are offering a relocation package, and if so, what is included. Immigration New Zealand has created the Keeping it Clear resource to use when writing for migrants. Keeping it Clear Shortlist CVs without bias In New Zealand, we like to give everyone a fair go. But research shows that applicants with ”English language names” tend to get significantly more requests for information and invitations to interviews than those without. Businesses that allow bias to affect their hiring processes can miss out on the benefits that diversity can bring to their workplace. They could also miss out on finding the best person for the role. One way to avoid bias is to adopt blind reviewing when assessing CVs. This means getting a person independent of the recruitment process to remove applicant names from applications before they are assessed. This avoids unconscious stereotyping and makes sure the focus stays on what matters — the experience and skills needed to the job well. A few tips for evaluating CVs: Look at the relevance of the applicant’s skills and experience in reference to the job profile Think about the value the person could bring to the wider organisation Consider diversity when shortlisting candidates.

Access to support networks It is a good idea to help your migrant employee and their family discover the community support networks that are available to them before they arrive. It will help them plan their new life, and feel confident they have a support network in place for the crucial first few months. Be sure to pass on ideas you have for making contacts and connections with people in New Zealand, including joining Newcomers’ Networks, local community projects or a sports club. Newcomers' Networks Community involvement Local projects where everyone works for a common benefit and shared goal are great at bringing people together and creating bonds. There are always lots to be done in the community. Community groups and school committee projects are usually very social. Getting involved with school activities and fundraising, or even the Board of Trustees, has the added benefit of putting your migrant employee in touch with their children’s teachers.

        "main_content": "As you can see in the illustration below, your new employee is getting to grips with a new workplace and an entirely new country. The challenges outside the workplace can sometimes impact on performance at work. They will have to adjust to new ways of living, new road rules, banking systems and tax laws. Settling in to New Zealand will take time and it is useful for you, as their employer, to have an understanding of that settlement process. Keep an eye on your new employee to make sure they are coping with their situation. Many migrant employees bring partners and their families, and will need time at the start of their employment to organise their new life in New Zealand: finding a house and a car, organising a bank account, a phone, a power supply, an IRD number as well as finding a doctor and a dentist, a school for the children etc. Tips for integrating your new staff member Organise some staff family days to get everyone together. Encourage your existing staff to include the new migrant and family in social activities. Larger companies may set up a partners’ network so the partners can meet and support each other. Family and Community Worker wellbeing Workplace communication and culture Six Stages of the settlement process New migrants are likely to go through a few highs and lows as they settle here. It helps if both you and your migrant workers understand that going through the highs and lows of settlement is normal. Fun – migrants are often really excited when they first arrive in their new country. Everything’s new and interesting, and they’ll be generally optimistic about the future. Fright – at some point the initial enthusiasm will take a knock. Migrants may be missing home, especially their friends and extended family. Any initial setbacks will see them question whether they’ve made the right decision for them and their family. Flight – this is a natural reaction to difficult circumstances. If the migrant and their family find themselves isolated, not making friends and new networks, and perhaps struggling to integrate into New Zealand life and culture, they might decide coming here was a mistake. Fight – most migrant choose to stay and deal with the challenges. If migrants are well supported both at work and in the community, they’ll get through the initial culture-shock and find plenty of reasons to stay. Fit – this is the final stage of settlement. Migrants who stay, will start to feel at home in New Zealand. The things they found exciting initially, will become part of everyday normality important again. And the problems they faced at  first won’t seem that bad after all. You should expect that your new migrant employee will go through these changes of mood. Your workplace and the community in which your employee will live might be very unfamiliar to them. Strong support networks, at work and at home, will help them to settle more easily. The key to managing the settlement process well is good preparation. The better migrants are prepared for the positives and negatives of working and living here, the more likely they are to settle well.

There are guides specific to industries (including dairy, construction, and aged care). Resources for you Resources for your migrant staff"

Workplace communication and culture Assign a buddy Having a buddy system can help your migrant employee to learn more efficiently and integrate into the team faster. It also helps iron out any small problems that come up along the way and gives your new migrant employee someone to talk to and ask questions. A good buddy can help your new employee understand the workplace and culture better and settle in to work and life more quickly. Preparing for migrant staff A safe workplace Your migrant employee may come to your workplace with different understandings about safety at work. It is your responsibility to ensure they have a safe workplace, with the right training, supervision and equipment. You must also help in identifying, assessing and managing hazards. This information needs to be communicated to your staff in a way that they can understand. WorkSafe New Zealand employment law It is a legal requirement to provide your employees with a written employment agreement. This may be new to employees from other countries, so it is important to provide migrant employees with a clearly written employment agreement. This will help reduce the risk of misunderstanding. Your new employee may also want to read their signed written employment agreement to familiarise themselves with New Zealand employment conditions, such as work hours, leave entitlements and public holidays. Annual leave, public holidays, and sick leave may also be new to your migrant employee. Clearly communicating what leave conditions they are entitled to will help their understanding. For more information on employment relations, pay, holidays, and health and safety, go to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s website or call the Ministry’s helpline. Your new employee also needs to know that they can call the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s helpline and they can request “Language Line” if they want an interpreter. Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Wellbeing outside the workplace Healthcare in New Zealand Encourage your new employee to sign up with their local General Practitioner (GP) as soon as they can. Enrolling with a GP lets them qualify for subsidised healthcare when they need to see a doctor (if on an eligible visa).

Industry issues and enforcement are dealt with by the authority.",
        "main_content": "Legislation The Immigration Advisers Licensing Act (2007) (the Act) aims to protect consumers and enhance New Zealand’s reputation as a destination for migrants. The Act requires people who give New Zealand immigration advice to be licensed, unless they’re exempt from licensing. Immigration Advisers Licensing Act 2007 The Immigration Advisers Licensing Regulations (2008) support the Act and provide for a range of licensing fees, including an immigration adviser’s levy. Immigration Advisers Licensing Regulations 2008 The Act sets up: the Immigration Advisers Authority (IAA) the Registrar of Immigration Advisers the Immigration Advisers Complaints and Disciplinary Tribunal. The Immigration Advisers Authority The Immigration Advisers Authority (IAA) uses competency standards and a code of conduct to set and monitor standards for licensed immigration advisers (LIAs). The Minister for Immigration approved both documents: Competency standards Code of Conduct The Registrar of Immigration Advisers The Registrar makes decisions to license immigration advisers and deals with complaints against LIAs. The Immigration Advisers Complaints and Disciplinary Tribunal The Tribunal deals with complaints referred by the Registrar and hears appeals about licensing decisions.  It can make decisions like cancelling an adviser’s licence or ordering an adviser to refund their fees. Immigration Advisers Complaints and Disciplinary Tribunal Enforcement and penalties IAA enforcement tools The IAA uses a range of enforcement tools to make sure licensed advisers meet their obligations under the Act and the Code of Conduct. The IAA promotes self-resolution as the first step in any complaints process. It takes a proactive approach by raising awareness of issues directly with the industry. Beyond this, the IAA can: raise awareness of issues through its website and publications contact advisers directly to work through potential non-compliance issues proactively send warning or information letters to educate advisers inspect an adviser’s premises and gather information if it suspects non-compliance refuse to renew an adviser’s licence if the adviser doesn’t meet competency standards refer complaints to the Immigration Advisers Complaints and Disciplinary Tribunal. There are offences under the Act relating directly to licensed advisers. It’s an offence to provide false or misleading information to the IAA when applying for, or renewing, a licence. The Registrar, or a person authorised by the Registrar, can enter an adviser’s premises.  It’s an offence under the Act to obstruct them. It’s also an offence for a licensed adviser to fail to notify the Registrar of a change in their circumstances. These offences all have fines of up to $10,000. Penalties for giving unlicensed advice It’s an offence to provide immigration advice unless you’re licensed or exempt from licensing. It’s also an offence to receive money for giving unlicensed immigration advice. Both of these offences carry fines of up to $100,000 and/or up to 7 years in prison. It’s an offence to claim that you are an immigration adviser, or a Licensed Immigration Adviser, when you’re not. People claiming to be immigration advisers face fines of up to $10,000 and/or up to 2 years in prison. It’s also an offence to employ an unlicensed or non-exempt immigration adviser. An employer who employs or contracts an adviser who is unlicensed, or not exempt, to give advice could face fines of up to $10,000 and/or up to 2 years in prison. Migrants should check if their adviser is licensed. If an adviser doesn’t appear on the register of immigration advisers and is not exempt, Immigration New Zealand will return their application. We’ll also contact the Registrar of Immigration Advisers. Ensure your details are correct on the licensed immigration adviser register"

HOST Aotearoa New Zealand will also support community organisations in applying to become approved sponsors. Once organisations are approved, HOST Aotearoa New Zealand will also provide coaching and training. The approved community organisations will provide direct settlement support to refugees for the full two years of their sponsorship programme. Local community sponsors will provide personal contact and practical advice, helping newcomers to secure rental housing, enrol in education and health services, find jobs and form connections within their new community. Video — Refugee Sponsorship programme introduction View transcript  All over the world there are millions of people around the world who have had to flee their countries, leaving everyone and all they knew behind. Although most refugees remain in areas close to their country, some have to travel further to find a new home. This is where the New Zealand Refugee Sponsorship Programme comes in. It creates a special opportunity for ordinary people to do something very direct and very tangible to help refugees. In this innovative programme, community sponsors are matched with a refugee before they come to New Zealand. Sponsors provide the support that the refugees need to start their new life. Anyone can be a sponsor. Sponsors' backgrounds and experiences can vary, but they will do the same thing: they offer their time and knowledge to sponsored refugees as they settle in to the community. There are lots of details to consider, so, before they arrive, sponsors prepare detailed plans to show how they will meet their responsibilities. These settlement plans not only help the sponsors get organised, but also ensure that refugee families are fully cared for. The plans have to be reviewed and approved by the government. From the first day a refugee arrives, sponsors assist them and help them settle in communities. Prior to arrival they will help the sponsored refugees by finding them a home and furnishings, providing it with essentials, and then assisting them to get set up with the basic needs, such as food, clothing, and transportation. Sponsors also help with the daily routine. It sounds like a lot of work, and it is, which is why sponsors work in groups. Any kind of group could potentially be a community sponsor with the Refugee Sponsorship programme. This could be as few as five people, provided they are prepared to commit to the sponsorship programme. But remember, it is a big commitment, and everyone must undergo police checks. It’s not a casual commitment, but can be extremely rewarding. Existing Non-government organisations might find Refugee Sponsorship to be an exciting new initiative that fits with some existing activities. Immigration New Zealand has appointed Host Aotearoa New Zealand to be the Umbrella organisation for the Refugee Sponsorship programme Host Aotearoa New Zealand will provide a hub that individual sponsorship groups can use to share issues and successes. Within the sponsor group, teamwork will help sponsors to manage the tasks of preparation and assistance for their sponsored refugee, such as understanding specific personal and cultural needs, and working out ways to address them - which could include fundraising. Refugee sponsorship is a special opportunity for individual Kiwis to take a direct role in the welcoming and successful settlement of refugees. This is different from the NZ Refugee Quota programme, which relies on settlement organizations to settle refugees, often with the help of volunteers. Refugee Sponsorship is special as it puts the local community at the heart of the programme. Right from the start, they will help the new arrivals access government and community training and support, while working directly with them, to help them become self-sufficient in their new community. When communities collaborate with the common goal of helping a family to rebuild and succeed, they too are strengthened. The experience of intercultural exchanges and learning breaks down barriers and builds mutual acceptance and understanding. This not only transforms the lives of sponsors and refugee families, but also makes communities more welcoming places. When communities open their doors to newcomers, they also open their hearts and minds. Learn more about Refugee Sponsorship in New Zealand here: immigration.govt.nz/refugee-sponsorship"

Funds It is important your group or organisation has evidence of sufficient funds to plan for the sponsored refugee families’ initial settlement needs. Although families in this programme are permanent New Zealand residents and can apply for Work and Income support, approved sponsors need to think about how they can help with additional settlement costs. Accommodation Approved community organisations will be responsible for finding suitable private accommodation for the sponsored refugee family before they arrive in New Zealand. Approved community organisations will need to cover the initial costs of accommodation, but are not required to pay rent for the duration of the sponsorship time. Sponsors will need to provide core furniture and other household goods on the sponsored refugee’s arrival in New Zealand. Networks Your group also needs evidence of experience working with refugees or other vulnerable people. Approved community organisations need to have the networks and connections across the community to support refugees to live fulfilling and meaningful lives in New Zealand. As an approved sponsor, you need to connect refugees to te ao Māori and the history of the whenua. This is an important part of cultivating shared cultural understanding."

        "main_content": "27 February 2024 2 minute read The review was announced in August last year by the former Government’s Minister of Immigration. The review looked at the appropriateness of all aspects of the employer accreditation and job check processes undertaken by Immigration New Zealand (INZ) as part of the AEWV scheme. The review makes 4 main findings: It was reasonable for the Deputy Secretary - Immigration to issue instructions to staff with the aim of reducing AEWV processing times given the pressure to access migrant labour after the reopening of the border INZ should have undertaken a structured risk assessment before issuing the Instructions, although they were appropriate MBIE should have undertaken a dedicated risk assessment before extending the Instructions, alongside the targeted risk monitoring and review that was undertaken Senior INZ leadership did not pay adequate attention to concerns raised by some staff about the AEWV risk settings. The review makes 10 specific recommendations around reducing the risk of migrant exploitation, developing an integrated compliance and system monitoring model, improving intelligence gathering and resetting the relationship between INZ’s senior leaders and frontline staff. The implementation of the AEWV scheme coincided with the reopening of the border post COVID-19 and the review notes INZ was under extreme pressure to process an extremely high number of visas in short timeframes. The review notes that INZ and the wider MBIE have already made a number of changes to improve the administration of the AEWV scheme. Settings have been tightened since 30 June last year to introduce more checks and as a consequence processing times have increased. But the AEWV scheme has been hugely successful in enabling employers to recruit much needed migrant labour to boost the economy. The review is published on the Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission website.

Select the Subtitles/CC option. English transcript Businesses are encouraged to train, upskill and hire New Zealand workers. Where no Kiwis are available for a job, employers can look to hire a migrant on the Accredited Employer Work Visa or AEWV. To hire a migrant on the AEWV, there are three things you need to do. Obtain accreditation, pass a job check for the role you're seeking to fill, and invite a migrant worker to apply for a visa. To gain accreditation, you're required to hold a New Zealand business number, be registered as an employer with New Zealand's Inland Revenue, and you must be in a good financial position. You should also have no recent history of regulatory non-compliance. If there are any recruitment costs either in or outside New Zealand, these must be paid by you as the employer. You are obliged to give migrant workers information about their employment rights, tips and advice to help them settle into New Zealand, and information about how to access local community services. You must also allow migrant workers time to complete Employment New Zealand's online modules on employment rights during paid work hours. There are extra requirements for employers who want to place migrants with controlling third parties, such as labour hire companies. The accreditation process is designed to ensure only good employers can hire migrant workers and helps prevent migrant exploitation. Once you are accredited under the AEWV, you will need to apply for a job check for each job you want to hire a migrant for. Multiple positions for the same job can be included in one job check. Most employers need to advertise the job first to check if New Zealanders are available. The ad needs to include details about the role, the pay, the hours, and the skills and experience required. It must meet the minimum pay rate required for the role. For some roles, you must also engage with Work and Income to look for New Zealanders to fill the vacancy. If the role passes the job check, the migrant worker can apply for a visa to work in that job once you check they are both suitably qualified for the role and meet the minimum skills requirement to be granted an AEWV. Some migrant workers also need to meet English language requirements. Immigration New Zealand then checks if they meet the requirements for the AEWV, and that they have the skills and experience you advertised for. If all three steps are approved, the migrant worker will be issued an AEWV. More information about the AEWV is on our website. Accreditation for the AEWV Employment New Zealand"

Select the Subtitles/CC option. English transcript Where no New Zealanders are available for a job, employers can hire a skilled migrant worker using the Accredited Employer Work Visa or AEWV. Before inviting a migrant to apply for an AEWV, employers must become accredited with Immigration New Zealand and complete a job check for the role they want to fill. This means migrant workers can have more confidence about the role they are coming to New Zealand for. To gain accreditation, an employer must be a genuine business in a good financial position and have no recent history of breaching employment or immigration law, or business standards. The job check confirms that the job pays the market rate and the terms and conditions of the contract comply with New Zealand's employment standards. Before applying for a job check, employers need to advertise most roles to check if New Zealanders are available. After an employer's job check has been approved, they must check that the migrant they want to hire is suitably qualified for the role and meets the minimum skills requirement to be granted an AEWV. Some migrant workers also need to meet English language requirements. If the employer believes you are suitable for the job, you will be sent an email containing a link and a job check token. This means you can access the online portal and apply for your visa. The application process is all done online where you will fill in your details and upload supporting documentation. Immigration New Zealand will check if you meet the requirements for the AEWV, and that you have the skills and experience the employer is seeking. Once you are employed, your employer must provide you with information to help you settle into life in New Zealand and give you time to complete Employment New Zealand's online modules on employment rights while you are at work.

        "main_content": "Report to Deputy Chief Executive (Immigration) on detention of asylum claimants In June 2021 Immigration New Zealand (INZ) commissioned an independent review by Victoria Casey KC (King's Counsel) — the 'Casey review'. The review: assessed the operational practices relating to restriction of freedom of movement, including detention, of people claiming asylum is specific to people who claim asylum at the border or those who claim when detained for the purposes of deportation. The recommendations from the review focused on: the inappropriateness of the use of Police and Corrections facilities to detain asylum seekers the need for better guidance on the systems and processes INZ staff use when considering the potential detention of asylum seekers the need to review INZ processes and legislation to ensure they are consistent with New Zealand's human rights obligations. The full report is on the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) website. INZ accepts review recommendations relating to the detention of asylum seekers — MBIE NOTE Most asylum seekers are not required to spend any time in detention. From 2015 to 2020 there were 2,655 asylum seekers in New Zealand, of which only 86 were detained. Claiming asylum is a separate process from the refugee quota system. People coming to New Zealand under the refugee quota system are recognised as refugees before they arrive and enter as permanent residents.  Both pathways allow people with a genuine need to be recognised as refugees and to find a new home in New Zealand. Information for asylum seekers Recommendations from the review The Casey review made 11 recommendations. INZ accepted all the recommendations. There were 3 recommendations for legislative change. There were 8 recommendations for operational changes. Recommendations about detaining people claiming asylum The Casey review recommended that INZ should ensure any decisions to detain asylum seekers: are consistent with the 2012 United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) Detention Guidelines are made at a senior level that is high enough to ensure we only detain people in exceptional cases that meet the high threshold, and are regularly reviewed. NOTE We rarely have situations where we need to detain an asylum seeker or restrict their freedom of movement. The 2012 UNHCR Detention Guidelines clearly describe these situations. For each case, we start with the fewest restrictions possible. Our response to the recommendations INZ established a programme of work to: implement the operational recommendations as soon as practicable, and ensure we have systems and processes which ensure decisions are made consistent with the 2012 UNHCR Detention Guidelines. We will consider recommendations for legislative change as part of any future review of the Immigration Act 2009. We have also set up the Decision-making Panel on Restriction of Freedom of Movement of Asylum Claimants. Decision-making Panel on Restriction of Freedom of Movement of Asylum Claimants The purpose of the Panel is to ensure that decisions to restrict the freedom of movement of asylum claimants are consistent with the 2012 UNHCR Detention Guidelines. The Chief Operating Officer of INZ selected the panel members to ensure: integrity of the regulatory system the welfare of asylum claimants, and mitigation of risks to New Zealand. The Panel meets as soon as possible after being notified of a claim. The Panel also meets every 2 weeks — or earlier if required — to review current cases. Panel terms of reference 24 April 2023 Purpose 1. This document outlines the purpose, scope and function of the Decision-making Panel on Restriction of Freedom of Movement of Asylum Claimants (the Panel). Background 2. In June 2021, Immigration New Zealand (INZ) commissioned a review by Victoria Casey KC of INZ processes and procedures relating to restriction of movement of asylum (refugee and protection status) claimants. 3. The final report resulting from the review was provided to INZ on 23 March 2022. 4. Key recommendations from the review were that INZ should ensure decisions to restrict the movement of asylum claimants are: consistent with the 2012 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Detention Guidelines, and made at a sufficiently high level to ensure that detention is limited to exceptional cases which meet the high threshold required, and that these decisions are regularly reviewed. 5. The establishment of the Panel responds to that recommendation. Purpose and function of the Panel 6. The purpose of the Panel is to ensure that decisions to restrict the freedom of movement of asylum claimants are consistent with the 2012 UNHCR Detention Guidelines (see Annex One). 7. The Panel decides whether an asylum claimant: is to be subject to no restrictions and referred to the section 61 team for consideration as to whether to grant a visa under section 61 of the Immigration Act (and/or entry permission); or is to be subject to no restrictions, and released into the community without a visa (meaning the claimant remains unlawfully in New Zealand); or is to have their liability for deportation cancelled; or is provided with the opportunity to enter into a Residence and Reporting Requirements Agreement (RRRA); or is subject to an application to the District Court for a Warrant of Commitment (WOC). This includes situations in which an individual makes a claim for asylum once they have been served with a Deportation Liability Notice or a Deportation Order and have already been arrested and detained for the purposes of deportation or turnaround under Part 9 of the Immigration Act 2009; or if detained under a WOC, is subject to an application to Release on Conditions (ROC); or if subject ROC, is also subject to an application to the District Court to vary or cancel those conditions; or is arrested and detained by Police under section 313 of the Immigration Act 2009 who is otherwise liable for arrest and detention. 8. Such decisions will be made consistent with the 2012 UNHCR Detention Guidelines and relevant provisions of the Immigration Act 2009. 9. Panel members are immigration officers and authorised to make decisions under the following sections of the Immigration Act 2009: Sections 172 and 177 (Cancellation or suspension of deportation liability) Section 313 (Initial detention) Section 315 (Residence and reporting requirements) Section 316 (Warrant of Commitment) Section 324 (Review of WOC and ROC). 10. Where a decision is made to apply for a WOC to detain a person who is an asylum claimant, and that WOC is granted by a District Court Judge, the Panel will review the detention status of the individual on a two-weekly basis or earlier, where relevant new information becomes available, to ensure that the reasons for detention still apply (noting that WOCs are granted for periods of up to 28 days only). 11. Where a decision is made to enter into a RRRA under section 315 of the Immigration Act 2009, the Panel will review this status on a two-weekly basis or earlier, where relevant new information becomes available to ensure that the reasons for the RRRA still apply. 12. If any person claims asylum at the International Airport or during Compliance activity, staff are to notify the Panel Secretariat immediately. No claimants shall be detained in Police custody unless at the direction of the Panel; however where risks to the safety of INZ staff or the claimant are identified, Police should be contacted as a matter of course. 13. If a person claims asylum outside of normal business hours and the immigration officer believes that a restriction to their freedom of movement should apply, they must prepare a referral as a matter of priority while the Panel is convened at the earliest opportunity. In the event the Panel’s decision is required urgently and the Panel cannot be convened within one hour, the Chair will be available to receive a verbal update, assess the case, and determine whether any restriction on freedom of movement should be applied. This decision will be subsequently reviewed by the Panel at the earliest opportunity. Scope of decision-making 14. The Panel will not make decisions on recommendations to restrict the freedom of movement of individuals who have not claimed asylum. 15. The Panel will not use Section 61 of the Immigration Act 2009 to make visa decisions but may refer cases or provide recommendations to the specialised Section 61 team. Panel membership 16. Membership of the Panel was determined by INZ’s Chief Operating Officer to ensure integrity of the regulatory system and the welfare of asylum claimants while in detention whilst mitigating risks to New Zealand. Accordingly, the primary Panel members are sufficiently high-level positions within the offices of the Chief Operating Officer, the Refugee and Migrant Services branch and the Verification and Compliance branch. 17. Panel membership is linked to specific roles. The roles selected come with prerequisite skills, knowledge and experience within the immigration system for appointment to those roles. 18. In addition to the Panel members with decision-making powers, the Panel will also convene with the Special Counsel (Immigration) from MBIE Legal Services present to provide legal advice. Alternates 19. As the Panel operates seven days a week, it is necessary that flexibility and business continuity is built into the system, to ensure that decisions regarding potential restrictions on the freedoms of asylum claimants are made as soon as possible. 20. In addition to three primary members of the Panel, the Chief Operating Officer pre-approves three alternate members as listed in Paragraph 24. In the case of an alternate for the Special Counsel, Immigration (who acts in an advisory capacity to the Panel), pre-approval is sought from MBIE’s Chief Legal Advisor. The purpose of identified alternates is to ensure a quorum, in instances where one of the Panel members is unavailable. 21. The roles of Panel alternates are allocated to specific INZ positions (identified in Paragraph 24) based on same criteria mentioned in paragraphs 16-18. 22. Nominated alternates are provided with the same designation and training as primary Panel members. 23. Where a quorum is not achievable due to unavailability of Panel members or their alternates, the Chief Operating Officer may, at their discretion and in accordance with the requirements set out at paragraphs 16-18 above, request that another INZ staff member act as a temporary Panel member for the purpose of making decisions on recommendations concerning restrictions on freedom of movement of asylum claimants. Any temporary appointment and reasons behind it will be recorded in meeting notes. 24. Permanent membership of the Panel is comprised of: Role Title and Organisation Chair Chief Operating Officer, INZ Member / Alternate Chair General Manager, Refugee and Migrant Services, INZ Member Principal Business Advisor, Verification and Compliance, INZ Alternate / Alternate Chair National Manager, Business Operations, INZ Alternate National Manager, Refugee and Migrant Services, INZ Alternate Principal Business Advisor, Assurance, INZ Special Counsel (Advisory function only) Special Counsel, Immigration, MBIE Alternate Counsel Legal Manager or Legal Director, LEAP, MBIE Chair 25. The Chief Operating Officer serves as the Chair of the Panel and is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the decision-making process. The Chair is also responsible for appointing Panel members and ensuring that decisions are only made by the Panel where there is a quorum. 26. In the absence of the Chief Operating Officer, the role of Chair will be taken by the General Manager, Refugee and Migrant Services in the first instance (as the designated alternate Chair). In case of both being absent, the role of Chair will be filled by (in order): National Manager, Business Operations, INZ National Manager, Refugee and Migrant Services, INZ. Conflicts of interest 27. All Panel members must declare any actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest. In all cases where a conflict of interest exists, or may be reasonably perceived to exist, the Chair will decide whether the member, having disclosed the interest, may participate for a particular decision as an active member of the Panel, or is not suitable to sit on the Panel for that decision. 28. To avoid the potential for perceived conflict of interest, officials in the following roles cannot be considered for any future Panel Membership (either as a primary member or as an alternate): National Manager, Border Operations National Manager, Compliance Operations General Manager, Border and Visa Operations General Manager, Verification and Compliance INZ staff designated as Refugee Protection Officers INZ staff designated as Compliance Officers. Meetings Frequency of meetings 29. Panel members or delegates must be available to convene at the earliest available opportunity to ensure that decisions on potential restrictions on freedom of movement are assessed. 30. The Panel will meet on a two-weekly basis (or earlier if required, where new information becomes available), to review current detention, and RRRA/ROC cases to ensure that the reasons for restriction on liberty still apply. Quorum 31. Three members (or alternates) must be in attendance for any decisions to be made. Decision making 32. The Chair will seek consensus from the Panel; if there is no consensus, final decisions rest with the Chair. Meeting location 33. Meetings will be held on Microsoft Teams in the first instance, or alternatively at the MBIE Stout Street office if members are there during working hours. There is no requirement to attend in person. Secretariat function 34. The Panel will be supported by a Secretariat which will: Be responsible for ensuring that all relevant information is available to the Panel on which to base its decisions. Liaise on the Panel’s behalf with operational staff where additional information is required. Communicate decisions to relevant operational staff.

        "main_content": "Talk to any visitor to Aotearoa New Zealand and the first things they are likely to comment on are the beautiful scenery and the friendly locals. Kiwis are seen as friendly, hospitable and inclusive — qualities highlighted by Welcoming Communities Te Waharoa ki ngā Hapori. There are 34 local councils and 5 local boards working with their communities to implement Welcoming Communities, a programme that puts the welcome mat out to newcomers: recent migrants, former refugees and international students Video — Welcoming Communities NZ introduction and outline (1:50) View transcript  *Female voice with music in the background. From the far north to the deep south, from tangata whenua (people of the land) to our newest kiwis, Aotearoa New Zealand is home to people and cultures from around the globe. Our diversity is our strength; it’s what makes us a vibrant and attractive place to be. But people don’t just move to a place. They move to communities. So how we choose to welcome and include new people into those communities, is up to all of us. That’s why we are inviting you to join Welcoming Communities – Te waharoa ki ngā hapori. As a town, city, or region, becoming a Welcoming Community shows your commitment to diversity and inclusion. It means putting out the welcome mat, so people from all cultures and backgrounds see you as a welcoming place to live, learn, work and visit. As a Welcoming Community, you’ll have access to resources, practical tools and expert guidance that will help support the good work you’re doing. You’ll be able to celebrate your successes, share your innovative ideas and learn new approaches with councils and communities around the country. You can also choose to be accredited, according to our national standard. So you can share pride in your progress, grow your welcoming practices and unlock the social, cultural and economic potential of your communities. Being a Welcoming Community means building a positive, welcoming reputation. It's practicing manaakitanga (hospitality, the process of showing generosity and care for others), by showing that your community is welcoming to everyone, no matter where you’re from or what language you speak. And importantly, it means partnering with mana whenua (the indigenous people (Māori) with historic and territorial rights over the land in your area) and others in your community, to make the places we love, more welcoming and inclusive for everyone. Because here in Aotearoa, Welcoming Communities are stronger communities. So join us by searching Welcoming Communities New Zealand. Communities that make newcomers feel welcome are likely to enjoy better social outcomes, and stronger economic growth. In this environment, everyone is able to participate in the economic, civic, cultural and social life of the community. Building connections between locals and newcomers means everyone feels included and knows they belong. Welcoming Communities rational and intended outcomes PDF 870KB How we support Welcoming Communities The support provided by Immigration New Zealand includes the following four components: Knowledge sharing Supporting local councils and communities to learn from each other and access resources.

Her tīpuna/ancestors are from Ireland and first started to arrive in Aotearoa from 1877.

There she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology and International Relations, and an Honours degree in Psychology (First Class). Michaela’s journey to understand and help people has led her to many roles and opportunities – from community probation to local government, to life coaching and group facilitation, and more recently to the biggest journey of all: motherhood. Michaela now lives in Paetūmōkai/Featherston with her amazing partner, precious toddler and excitable dog. Michaela says, “as I’ve gotten older, I’ve become uncomfortably aware that the colonisation of this country has afforded me great privilege as pākeha, but it has cost our tangata whenua immensely.” Michaela is passionate about having a collaborative, partnership approach so the South Wairarapa can be a welcoming and inclusive home where people from all corners of the globe and Māori can thrive. Michaela believes that our differences not only make us stronger, but they make life much more interesting! Aotearoa has been such an incredible home to Michaela and she’s excited and honoured to be a part of the welcoming communities programme.

Silvia worked for nearly 9 years for New Zealand Red Cross in the areas of settlement and employment of refugee background persons. Silvia describes herself having a natural inclination to connect with people from all ethnic backgrounds and walks of life.

She is passionate about diversity, inclusion and equity and considers them as integral parts of any welcoming community. Silvia completed a Certificate in Intercultural Studies to complement her Post-Graduate Diploma in Adult Education and bachelor’s degree in Education.

Raj Seneviratne Welcoming Communities Coordinator, Rotorua Lakes Council My family and I emigrated to New Zealand from Sri Lanka in 2011, where my wife came as a student. She is now a Resource Teacher Learning and Behaviour, working in schools locally in Rotorua. We have two children, our son is almost 21 and is at Waikato Uni in his last year completing his Bachelor of Business, and our daughter is in her last year of high school. As a new migrant all those years ago Settlement Support network personally helped me to get started and pointed me in the right direction by introducing me to the New Kiwis program, etc. (conducted by the Auckland Chamber of Commerce). However, I know the migrant journey isn’t an easy one and most new migrants don’t know where to go or who to ask. Therefore, I am all the more passionate about this role as I am now in a position where I can help those who come in to our city to get settled in by being that “go to” person. The Welcoming Communities Coordinator’s role is part of the Thriving Communities group of the Rotorua Lakes Council. Natalie Paterson Welcoming Communities Facilitator, Hurunui District Council After spending some time abroad Natalie returned home to North Canterbury about 10 years ago.

Natalie currently manages the Together Hurunui network of some 200+ providers which identifies gaps in their social sector and works to close them. Much of that work sees her advocating for local migrants and newcomers. She is looking forward to getting started in the Welcoming Communities role which complements the partnerships and networks she has already developed. Natalie and her husband have travelled extensively, even taking a year off pre-covid to do just that. That experience gave them an opportunity to learn, listen and explore life that was very different to life in NZ. Upon arriving home, they embarked on another adventure converting an old Anglican Church into a home in the Hurunui High Country. Heather Barnes Welcoming Communities Coordinator, Marlborough District Council Heather is from Canada and came to Aotearoa on the working holiday programme as a sea kayak guide 10 years ago.

She got the inspiration to work for community after working in India as a Teacher and Education Coordinator. She worked towards girls’ education and their empowerment in rural parts of India. She likes meeting and supporting people from all over the world. Being an immigrant herself she found it hard to know things and where to go for help.

Arti loves supporting people and is looking forward to making Masterton a welcoming space for everyone. Heather Harries Welcoming Communities Officer, Central Otago District Council Heather proudly holds dual nationality for both Kenya and New Zealand; although global citizenship is an enormous privilege, she has also experienced first-hand the challenges of finding a place of true belonging.

She has lived the majority of her life in East Africa but was educated in Scotland and New Zealand. In 2018, Heather moved back to New Zealand as a single mother with 3 daughters. Although New Zealand was familiar to her, she was struck by how hard it was to “fit in” for her family. Heather’s role as an ESOL Tutor highlighted the additional struggles for migrants learning an entirely new language and culture. This ultimately led her to become a member of the Welcoming Communities Advisory Group in Central Otago, which has evolved into the role of Welcoming Communities Officer. She continues to work as an ESOL Tutor. Heather feels so lucky to have work that is meaningful and fulfilling – and to work in a space that aims to breakdown boundaries and build strong, sincere connections.

Misty Sansom Welcoming Communities Coordinator, Kaipara District Council Tēnā koutou katoa. He uri ahau nō Te Uruwera; kō Tūhoe tōku iwi. I whānau mai ahau ki Taranaki, ā kei Mangawhai ahau e noho ana. E mahi ana ahau ki te Kaunihera o Kaipara, ā ko ahau te Kaitohutohu Hapori. Ko Misty tōku ingoa.

Sarah Deveau Welcoming Communities Coordinator, Manawatū District Council Sarah is a proud Canadian and mom to a wonderful daughter named Hayden. She met her now husband while he was on his classic Kiwi OE – working at a ski hill in Canada. Sarah first became invested in making the world a more equitable place while volunteering for the Elizabeth Fry Society – a feminist organisation dedicated to helping women through the criminal justice system. Years spent working hospitality alongside mostly immigrant staff opened her eyes to the automatic privileges given to her due to her Caucasian looks. At a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion conference Sarah learned that diversity without inclusion is tokenism. This insight gave her the determination to leverage her privilege by holding space for others to share their stories and have a voice at the decision table. Having spent her first 5 years in New Zealand working in Infrastructure, Sarah is happy to be back in the Community space and to her passion. As New Zealand is the third country she has called home, Sarah is no stranger to the immigrant experience. She understands the intricacies of adapting to her new home while remaining true to her heritage. Thus, she has decided to develop her programme based on a Canadian analogy, describing immigration as a salad bowl. Simply put, people come as all kinds – lettuce, tomatoes, bell peppers, etc. Individually we are pretty good, but combined we make for something more vibrant and fulfilling. Yet even when everyone is mixed in, our unique cultural identity remains intact and celebrated. Partnership websites Ministry for Ethnic Communities Human Rights Commission"

        "main_content": "Immigration fraud includes the following offences: using a false or altered document to support a visa application, for example passport providing false or misleading information to support a visa application helping someone to come to or stay in New Zealand who you know either does not have a visa or does not have the right visa helping someone to come to New Zealand who you deceive about the type of work they will be doing in New Zealand or your reasons for bringing them to New Zealand. What we do about immigration fraud We have a team of dedicated fraud investigators who prosecute people for immigration fraud. The measures we use to prevent and detect immigration offending include: screening all passengers when they check in at overseas airports. We do this to prevent people who pose a risk to the integrity of our immigration system from travelling to New Zealand. We can also question passengers when they arrive in New Zealand sharing biometric information like fingerprints with the United Kingdom, the United States of America (US), Australia, and Canada, which together with New Zealand form the Five Country Conference , a forum for immigration and border security checking all travellers flying to, through or from New Zealand against an international database containing details of all recorded stolen and lost travel documents carefully checking visa applications and verifying any documents provided to support those applications following up on any information we get about potential immigration fraud using technology to detect fraud, eg passport scanners starting a Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme. The scheme allows approved employers to hire workers from various Pacific countries for seasonal work in New Zealand’s horticulture and viticulture industries . It has reduced the exploitation of unlawful foreign workers significantly since it started in 2008. Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme Penalties Those found guilty of immigration fraud can be imprisoned for up to 7 years and/or fined up to NZ $100,000. People who use immigration fraud to become New Zealand residents can be deported. People who use immigration fraud to become New Zealand citizens can lose their citizenship. Education providers We work with the Ministry of Education and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority to make sure education providers offer good quality education services to international students. Providing education for international students adds about NZ $2.3 billion to New Zealand's economy each year, making it one of our top 5 export earners. If we are unhappy with how an education provider is operating, we can suspend or terminate the processing of applications to study there. Sex work People who come to New Zealand on temporary visas are not allowed to work in commercial sexual services. Immigration New Zealand investigates sex workers who try to work illegally. We take action against anyone who hires or helps sex workers come to New Zealand. Sex workers working in New Zealand illegally can be deported and may not be able to return. Reporting suspected immigration fraud Anyone who suspects immigration fraud should call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."

People trafficking does not have to involve crossing a border and often happens entirely within a country. Both migrants and citizens/residents can be impacted. Note More information is available on how to help victims of people trafficking. Help for victims of people trafficking People trafficking doesn’t have to take place across borders and often happens entirely within a country. It doesn’t happen just to migrants; citizens and residents can be victims too. What is people trafficking? Information for the community and government PDF 2MB Is there people trafficking in New Zealand? People trafficking happens in New Zealand. Since 2015 there have been four people trafficking prosecutions, with at least 51 victims identified. However, given the hidden nature of the crime and the reluctance of victims to come forward, this figure is likely to be just the tip of the iceberg. Walk Free estimated that in 2016 around 3,000 people in New Zealand were in conditions of modern slavery. Global Slavery Index — Walk Free In September 2016, a man was convicted of 15 people trafficking charges and other Immigration Act 2009 offences, for offending related to 15 Fijian nationals he brought to New Zealand and exploited. The offender was sentenced to 9 years and 6 months imprisonment, and ordered to pay $28,000 in reparations to his victims. A second man was convicted of other immigration offences related to the same case, and was sentenced to 1 year home detention and ordered to pay $55,000 in reparations to his victims. In addition to his criminal sentence, his house was forfeited in 2021 as some of the money he used to buy it was obtained through exploiting the victims in this case. In March 2020 a man was convicted of 10 people trafficking and 13 slavery charges. His offending related to 13 Samoan nationals that he arranged to bring to New Zealand and enslave between 1994 and 2017. He was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment, including a minimum non-parole period of 5 years, and ordered to pay $183,000 in reparations to his victims. What happens to people traffickers in New Zealand? People trafficking is criminalised under Section 98D of the Crimes Act 1961 and is punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $500,000, or both. Crimes Act 1961— New Zealand Legislation In addition to imprisonment, people traffickers can also have any profits from the trafficking taken away, property used for trafficking confiscated, and be made to pay compensation to victims. Migrant exploitation is also criminalised under section 351 of the Immigration Act 2009 and punishable with up to seven years imprisonment of seven years, a fine of up $100,000, or both. The New Zealand Police and Immigration New Zealand will continue to investigate and respond to any allegations of people trafficking. What is the government doing to eliminate people trafficking? New Zealand’s response to people trafficking is set out in the Plan of Action against Forced Labour, People Trafficking and Slavery Plan of Action against Forced Labour, People Trafficking and Slavery — MBIE The Plan of Action is organised across three key pillars: Prevention, Protection, and Enforcement. These pillars are underpinned by a partnership approach, with effective partnerships across government agencies, civil society, business, unions, academia and internationally being critical to success. The plan describes Government actions planned between 2020 – 2025. A wide range of key agencies are responsible for the government’s efforts to address forced labour, people trafficking and slavery, and their responsibilities are captured in the Plan of Action. International cooperation The New Zealand Government works with countries in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond to combat people trafficking. This includes working with international counterparts on cross-border people trafficking cases, and people trafficking training. We also participate in international forums, including: Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking and Related Transnational Crime About the Bali Process — baliprocess.net Pacific Immigration Directors Conference Pacific Immigration Directors Conference — pidcsec.org Migration Five New Zealand also works with international agencies, such as the International Organisation for Migration, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. We are also committed to building strong relationships with non-governmental organisations, both domestically and internationally. New Zealand is ranked at Tier 2 in the 2024 United States Trafficking in Persons Report. This means the US determined that we are not fully compliant with their Trafficking Victims Protection Act, but are making significant efforts to do so. The report notes that the New Zealand Government demonstrated overall increasing efforts compared with the previous reporting period. 2024 Trafficking in Persons Report — US Department of State Migrant exploitation As part of a wider Government initiative to combat all forms of exploitation, which is supported by $50m in funding, the Government has enacted measures to better protect migrants from exploitation. While not all victims of trafficking are migrants, and not all victims of trafficking will be exploited, migrants are particularly vulnerable to both trafficking and exploitation. The new measures include a visa to support migrants to leave exploitative situations quickly and remain lawfully in New Zealand, a dedicated 0800 number and web form to make it easier to report migrant worker exploitation.

Section 98C of the Crimes Act 1961 What ‘people smuggling’ is People smuggling is when someone arranges for a migrant to enter, or be brought into, another country: for a material benefit like a fee (these can be four times the migrant’s annual salary) without caring if the migrant is permitted to enter that country. How people smuggling harms migrants People smugglers and facilitators (those who help them) often mislead migrants about: the risks of being smuggled chances of success economic conditions in the countries they are smuggled into. Migrants smuggled either by land or sea are at risk of: travelling in unsuitable, overloaded, or otherwise unsafe transport physical or psychological violence being trafficked for forced labour or sexual exploitation dehydration, starvation, and sometimes death. International cooperation to prevent people smuggling New Zealand has international obligations to prevent and combat people smuggling by land, sea and air. We work closely with other countries to prevent people smuggling. Some of the ways New Zealand meets its obligations includes: membership of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. This is a regional forum for policy dialogue, information sharing and practical cooperation. It helps the Indo-Pacific region address people smuggling, trafficking in people, and its related crimes. co-chairing, together with Viet Nam, the Bali Process Working Group on the Disruption of Criminal Networks Involved in People Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons. The Bali Process Bali Process Working Group on the Disruption of People Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons Networks Mass arrivals of smuggled people into New Zealand A mass arrival is when over 30 people, who do not have permission to enter New Zealand, arrive on board one craft or more at the same time. If there was a New Zealand mass arrival, it would most likely happen via sea. To date, no maritime mass arrival attempt has successfully reached New Zealand. A successful mass arrival would put significant pressure on New Zealand’s resources and infrastructure. There is also the risk of migrant casualties due to unsafe conditions onboard or drowning. A successful attempt could also mean: more mass arrival attempts risk of more loss of life at sea. New Zealand’s mass arrival prevention strategy New Zealand aims to prevent a mass arrival through a strategy built on: proportional response, cooperation and partnerships fulfilment of international human rights and humanitarian obligations the need for a proactive, flexible and evolving approach. Working towards preventing mass arrivals into New Zealand Budget 2019 allocated $25 million over 2019-2023 to prevent in New Zealand. Key activities include: expanding New Zealand’s network of Migration Liaison Officers offshore to strengthen relationships with other countries. This means sharing information on people smuggling trends and approaches. encouraging potential migrants to choose regular pathways into New Zealand helping strengthen capacity and capability overseas to prevent people smuggling working with other countries to find people smuggling networks, disrupt or stop them, and hold smugglers accountable. Our work to prevent a mass arrival is part of the Government’s work on transnational organised crime and the Maritime Security Strategy: Transnational Organised Crime in New Zealand: Our Strategy is available on the New Zealand Police website The Maritime Security Strategy: Te Kaitiakitanga o Tangaroa is available on the Ministry of Transport website"

Before you start, you’re told exactly what evidence you need to provide based on your visa type, your nationality and where you’re travelling from. Providing this information helps us to understand what requirements your application must meet. New online tools help you complete your application form quickly and accurately, so we can make a decision about your application faster. Smart forms mean we only ask you relevant questions, based on the answers you give and the visa you’re applying for. Then, all you need to submit your online application is a passport-style photo and a credit or debit card. You don’t need to provide a medical certificate upfront anymore. Once you’ve submitted your application, we’ll assess whether any health evidence is required and we’ll check this against any records you might have provided to us as part of a previous application. If we need new or updated health evidence, we’ll request this from you. No more guesswork. While you’re waiting for a decision on your application, you can check its status on your Immigration Online dashboard. And don’t worry, we’ll send you an email notification if anything changes, or if we need more information from you. It’s also easy to share your online application with someone else if you need a little help. Some organisations, or a friend or family member, can help you to complete the online form. Or you can get immigration advice from an immigration lawyer or licensed adviser. And it’s not just visas. Employers can apply for accreditation and job checks using Immigration Online too. Online enhancements also mean multiple Immigration New Zealand case officers may be working to process your application at the same time. This will speed things up, meaning you’ll receive a decision sooner. To get started, visit immigration.govt.nz today. Video – Demonstration of INZ’s enhancements to Immigration Online Video – Demonstration of INZ’s enhancements to Immigration Online (5:11) View transcript  In the enhanced Immigration Online system, people can quickly and easily apply for and manage their applications. Maria needs to apply for a visa. On the Immigration New Zealand website, she can click the ‘I want to’ options to guide her to the right smart application form. Or she can log into her Immigration Online dashboard, using her RealMe login. Maria can easily follow this link to create a RealMe account if she doesn’t have one. Her account doesn’t need to be verified so she can get started on her application straight away. Once logged in, Maria is taken to her dashboard. Maria has a unique sharing ID. She can use this to share her application with others, like a friend or family member, or a professional like an immigration adviser. Professionals like immigration advisers can use networks to share applications with others in their organisation, and collaborate on applications. Maria clicks ‘My Visas’ to start her application. These are all the applications Maria has made, including those that are in draft or submitted, and any visas issued. Maria clicks here to apply for a visa. Maria is applying for a Visitor Visa. Answering these questions before she starts her application helps her check she’s picked the right visa type and will minimise any potential delays when INZ starts processing her application. Maria is the principal applicant so these are her details. She can add her partner or children, if the visa type allows. This is the first page of the smart application form. First, Maria must complete her identity details. After that she can move around the application using the progress bar. Not all tabs, sections and fields will appear for all applicants. For example, the purpose of visit tab only appears for the principal applicant. Some appear or disappear depending on the previous responses. If Maria is working with a licensed immigration adviser or an exempt person, they will need to state they are providing immigration advice in the ‘immigration assistance’ tab. Licensed advisers will need to provide their licence number. If Maria had any help completing her application, she will need to complete a declaration form which authorises for someone to assist her. This will need to be uploaded under the ‘supporting documents’ tab. When the application is complete, including all mandatory fields, the progress bar turns dark blue. The form lets Maria know if she’s missed a mandatory field or made a mistake when she clicked submit. This means Maria can feel confident she has provided everything required. Her application will be ready for assessment and reduce the likelihood of INZ asking for further information. When Maria submits her application, she’s prompted to pay a fee and the application enters the system for processing. Once submitted, Maria can keep an eye on her application’s progress in her dashboard. She can also view a summary of her application – or of any other application she has submitted. If Maria needs to provide further information to INZ, she will receive an email telling her to log into her account. Maria can click to read the letter, which outlines what she needs to provide. She can then upload her evidence by clicking ‘respond’. Once Maria’s application has been fully assessed, she will receive an email to let her know if her visa has been approved. She can log into her dashboard and check the ‘My Visas’ section to view her issued visa. That’s the end of the application process. It gives Maria an easy to use form where she always knows where she’s at in the process. And it gives INZ assessment ready applications that are complete and correct, and should reduce the need for customers to call our contact centre. Security and privacy Security and privacy The security and privacy of your personal information is important to us. The system will allow information to be shared securely with other organisations online, subject to authorisation from users, who will also be able to review and update their own online data."

It is important to note that migrant exploitation does not generally include situations where a company has gone into receivership/liquidation or made staff redundant. Issues arising as a result of a receivership, liquidation or redundancy are not usually considered to be exploitation. This includes: non-payment of previous week’s or final pay individual or one-off breaches of employment agreements Examples of migrant exploitation include when: your employer bullies or threatens you someone keeps your passport and money from you you cannot leave your workplace because the doors and windows are locked you must ask permission to eat, sleep, or go to the toilet you have no time off from work you are paid too little money or none at all your employer forces you to work to pay off a debt your employer threatens to harm you or your family if you do not do as you are told.

        "main_content": "22 May 2024 5 minute read With the ski season officially starting next month, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has advised that it is important that both employers and employees in the ski sector are aware of their rights and responsibilities under the law. This includes: complying with minimum employment standards ensuring workers have the right to work in this country and with the specific employer, and making sure accommodation available to employees meets the required standards. David Milne, the Labour Inspectorate’s Northern Regional Manager, who includes adventure sports in his portfolio, says ski field and related sector employers need to understand that no matter whether the employees are employed on a casual, part-time or fixed-term basis, they all have minimum employment rights. “This includes providing all workers with a written employment agreement, paying them at least the minimum wage if they are 16 years or older, allowing them meal and rest breaks, paying them for holidays, sick leave and for working on a public holiday.” Mr Milne says it is important that accurate records are kept of an employee’s time worked, payments, holidays and leave taken and entitlements. There are also some things employers must not do after hiring someone, including: deducting money without the employee’s permission asking them to pay a premium for hiring them or prior to hiring them demanding to keep their passport making the employee do a 90-day trial period, unless this has been agreed to in the employment agreement prior to starting work or the trial period is invalid asking an employee to deviate from their visa conditions or work while they do not have a valid visa. “Employers need to be aware that they can only make deductions for board and lodging if both parties agree to it, while there are also other terms of such an arrangement that need to be formalised,” says Mr Milne. Employee rights and responsibilities — Employment New Zealand Deductions — Employment New Zealand website Visa requirements Many overseas snow industry employees are here through the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) scheme as specialists like snowmakers, snow-groomers, and snow-patrollers. These are roles not able to be entirely filled from New Zealand’s labour pool. Last year’s first post-Covid ski season saw 160 ski employees granted AEWVs. The hospitality industry which supports the sector also requires skilled workers including chefs and restaurant managers who may also be eligible for an AEWV. Stephanie Greathead, MBIE’s National Manager, Immigration Compliance, says other visa holders who work in the snow and tourism sectors may do so on working holiday visas or student visas. “Regardless of the visa type, the onus is on the employer to ensure they know their employees are lawfully able to work in New Zealand. They’ll need to sight their passports and cross-check them to ensure they can legally work here. “Another important step is to ensure that the conditions of people’s work visas are met,” adds Ms Greathead. “Student visa holders for example are only allowed to work limited hours during their term time and there are varying conditions on working holiday visas, dependent on which is their country of origin. Employers need to check.” Ms Greathead says Immigration Compliance uses a graduated approach to help ensure employers are aware of and comply with their obligations, including for individual visa holders. These can include education and engagement with employers and can escalate to issuing infringements, formal warnings and even prosecution. Ms Greathead warns that it is illegal for employers to request a fee from a visa holder to secure a job or to demand to keep their passport. Migrant workers can find out more about their rights on Immigration New Zealand website. Immigration warns of 'too good to be true' job offers Check someone can legally work for you Accommodation for employees Depending on the weather and snow conditions, work for temporary workers may last for several months. People planning to stay for the full winter season may prefer fixed-term rental accommodation rather than staying short term in hostels or backpackers. Brett Wilson, National Manager, Tenancy Compliance and Investigations Team says, “it is important that employees understand their rights, and the landlord’s obligations when they look for accommodation, even just for a few weeks or months.” This will avoid potentially vulnerable employees being short changed or staying in accommodation that does not meet the required standards. “In some cases, the employer provides accommodation for the employee while they are working there. This is called a service tenancy and certain requirements must be met to comply with tenancy law,” says Mr Wilson. All new tenancies must comply with Healthy Homes Standards, which include specific minimum standards for heating, insulation, ventilation, moisture and drainage, and draught stopping in rental properties. Smoke alarms or detectors are compulsory in all rental properties and landlords must ensure they are working at the start of each new tenancy and remain in working order throughout. If people want to learn about renting a spare room or setting up a house as a rental property they can look at the videos and checklists on the Tenancy Services website.

        "main_content": "17 May 2023 4 minute read Changes to Partner of a Worker Work Visa have now been confirmed. These changes are part of the Government’s plan to rebalance the Immigration system to support a higher-productivity, higher-wage economy. Work conditions for partners of migrant workers People who successfully apply for a Partner of a Worker Work Visa on or after 31 May 2023 may have new conditions that mean: they can only work for an accredited employer \n Check if an employer is accredited they cannot be self-employed they cannot work below the median wage in roles covered by capped sector agreements . if they are working in a role: not covered by an uncapped sector agreement , they must be paid at least the median wage in effect at the time they receive their visa, or job offer, whichever is later. This is currently NZD $29.66. covered by an uncapped sector agreement, they must be paid at least the relevant wage threshold in place. They will not be subject to a stand-down period. This includes most partners of workers who hold an Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) or an Essential Skills Work Visa (ESWV). Partners do not need to have a job offer to apply for this visa, and employers do not need to complete a Job Check. When granted, partners can change employers without applying for a Variation of Conditions. There is no minimum number of hours that partners need to work. People who are currently employed will need to ensure their employment meets the conditions of their new visa when any new visa takes effect. People who are not employed will need to ensure any future job offer meets these conditions. Any later changes to the employer’s accreditation, the median wage and sector agreements will not impact the visa holder if they remain in the same employment. From 31 May, people will be able to check on the INZ website if an employer is accredited. The changes do not affect current work visa conditions or people who apply before 31 May 2023. There are no changes to visa conditions for partners of New Zealanders or partners of those holding other work visas (such as a Post Study Work Visa). Exceptions for partners of highly paid and Green List workers Some partners of AEWV or ESWV holders will continue to be eligible for a work visa allowing them to work in any occupation for any employer in New Zealand, with no median wage threshold. This includes partners of: migrants who are paid at least twice the median wage, or migrants who are working in a role on the Green List. These exceptions include migrants who did not meet these requirements when they received their visa, but have since met them through a pay increase or their role being added to the Green List. Evidence of eligibility will be needed as part of the Partner of a Worker Work Visa application, or through a Variation of Conditions request. Some AEWV and ESWV holders cannot support a partner work visa AEWV holders who are covered by a sector agreement and paid below the median wage are not eligible to support a partner work visa. ESWV holders paid below the median wage (or lower-skilled if the visa application was made before 27 July 2020) are also not eligible to support a partner work visa. If they receive a pay rise that means they earn at least the median wage, they may be able to support their partner for a work visa. They do not need to apply for a new work visa to support a partner, unless they want their eligibility for a longer work visa to be assessed based on the new salary. This is because partners generally receive a visa for the same length of time as their supporting partner’s work visa. Partners of temporary workers can explore other visas to see if they are eligible to apply in their own right. Partners who do not want to work can apply for a Visitor Visa.

        "main_content": "24 October 2023 4 minute read When applying for a New Zealand visa applicants may need to undergo a medical assessment to show they have an acceptable standard of health. Before we can approve an application for a residence or temporary visa, we check the applicant meets the visa’s criteria. The criteria helps us decide if we should decline or approve the application. With the acceptable standard of health criteria, we look to see if the applicant: is a risk to public health is going to add significant cost to, or demands on, New Zealand's health services is going to qualify for Ongoing Resourcing Scheme (ORS) funding may have to stop you working or studying due to their health, if that is what their visa is for. Ongoing Resourcing Scheme (ORS) — Ministry of Education An example of the types of questions included in an INZ immigration medical examination form is available in our General Medical Certificate form. General Medical Certificate (INZ 1007) PDF 517KB New Zealand’s publicly funded health system is a common good. Citizens, residents and people on work visas who are in New Zealand longer-term (with a visa over 2 years or more) have automatic access to our health system. There is no option to opt out of the health system as it provides universal coverage. Under immigration requirements, all applicants must have an acceptable standard of health to be granted a visa. If an applicant does not have an acceptable standard of health, there are multiple possible outcomes for their visa application. For example, they may be granted a medical waiver, or an exception to instructions (the criteria that visa applicants must meet). This is all decided on a case-by-case basis. Acceptable standard of health criteria for visa approvals Immigration health screening settings do not discriminate against individuals, but focus on assessing the likely impact of that individual’s medical condition on New Zealand’s public health services, special education services and on the health of the NZ public. Obesity The immigration medical examination that visa applicants may be required to undergo, collects a wide range of health information including an applicant’s weight, however, this is only one of many considerations. Obesity alone does not mean that a visa applicant does not have an acceptable standard of health. Obesity can be a risk factor for medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. If a visa applicant has such associated conditions, they may be determined not to have an acceptable standard of health and their application could be declined. For a resident visa application, a medical waiver may be able to be granted. The medical waiver process takes into account a number of factors including the objectives of the category they are applying under, the applicant’s connection to New Zealand and their likely contribution. BMI A Body Mass Index (BMI) measurement on its own is not currently used as a measure of whether a visa applicant has an acceptable standard of health or not. INZ medical assessors consider other health conditions and use a combination of tools to assist in determining associated risks. BMI has been required in INZ immigration medical examinations since April 2005 as a tool to assist in identifying obesity. We acknowledge that measuring BMI is imperfect and that it does not differentiate between body fat and muscle mass and that there are limitations in its applicability given that body fat distribution differs by ethnicity and other variables. In some cases, INZ may defer the applicant’s visa application for 3 months to allow time for them to begin reducing their BMI and to address any associated health conditions. Health"

Changes for sponsors We are lowering the income requirements for sponsors and allowing 2 adult children, rather than just an adult child and their partner, to combine their income to sponsor parents. A sponsor now needs to earn 1.5 times the New Zealand median wage rather than twice the median wage. This limit increases by half the median wage for each joint sponsor or additional parent. These new requirements apply to existing expressions of interest and those we receive from 12 October 2022. Sponsorship for the Parent Resident Visa New EOIs to be selected by ballot Any EOIs we receive from 12 October 2022 go into a ballot. The first random selection from the ballot is in August 2023, then every 3 months after that. EOIs must be submitted before the month of a ballot draw for them to be eligible for selection in that draw. There will be 500 visas available each year for EOIs selected by ballot. From May 2023 EOIs can be submitted online on the Immigration New Zealand website. EOI expiry EOIs that have not been selected from the ballot expire after 2 years. Those submitted closer to the ballot selection can stay in the ballot pool longer before expiring. Existing EOIs will be added to a queue Existing EOIs — these are EOIs we received before 12 October 2022 — will be added to a queue and selected in the date order we received them. We begin selecting them from the queue on 14 November 2022 and continue to select them every 3 months after that. It will take time for us to determine how long it will take to select all existing EOIs. Accurate timeframes will be added to our website. Parent Resident Visa EOI selection process If you have an existing EOI in the queue we will contact you and give you the opportunity to update or withdraw it. If you do not get an email from us you may need to update your contact details using the process to update your EOI. If you withdrew your EOI because you could not meet the previous income limit set before October 2019 we will invite you to resubmit an EOI to the queue. Withdraw or update an existing EOI An existing EOI can be updated in response to the new requirements, for example, joint sponsors may want to add an adult child, or withdraw their EOI. Anybody who withdraws their EOI can request a fee refund. EOIs selected will be assessed against the new requirements. Once we select it we will not refund the fee even if it is declined. Update or withdraw your parent visa expression of interest (EOI) We appreciate some people may have had to wait a long time since submitting their EOI to the existing queue, and that their situation may have changed during this time.

These are being updated to help support Aotearoa New Zealand’s economic growth and to provide more certainty to migrants and employers. Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa changes From 9 October 2023, the current settings will be replaced with a simplified points system that sets a clear skills threshold for residence and offers several ways for people to demonstrate their skill level. Changes to the Skilled Migrant Category Resident Visa Accredited Employer Work Visa changes The Government is introducing a maximum continuous stay of 5 years on an AEWV, for anyone who is unable to demonstrate that they are on a pathway to residence.

In October 2023 we announced our refugee employment pilot in Palmerston North. This pilot will support former refugees into employment that is meaningful and sustainable. The pilot will be tailored to support refugees to access employment and development opportunities relevant to their skills and aspirations. It will also be a way to engage with the private sector to reduce barriers to refugee employment. Workbridge — Te Arawhiti mō Mahi, a nation-wide provider of employment services, will be implementing the Refugee Employment pilot. Workbridge — Te Arawhiti mō Mahi has a long history of mahi with both jobseekers and employers bringing them together to develop employment opportunities that are both durable and meaningful. Workbridge — Te Arawhiti mō Mahi website Opening date Referrals are open now. Referrals to the service are made by government agencies and community organisations, such as: The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) The Ministry of Education Manawatū Chamber of Commerce Palmerston North City Council, and more.

This can be a period of significant change and information overload. MSD-funded employment Pathways 2 Employment Refugees who receive a benefit are eligible for the MSD-funded employment service which helps working age refugees prepare for employment, and matches job seekers with conversational English classes for a maximum of 6 months. The first job 61% of working age refugees who arrived in 2018/2019 were receiving an unemployment-related benefit 1 year after arrival. This number steadily decreased over time, to around 25% by year 5. Where to from here Once you are in employment, it can be hard to know where to go for career planning and development advice, networking, or to understand what opportunities are out there. This can lead to feeling trapped in employment situations, and not knowing how to find alternative work that is secure, and meaningful. Career planning and development Workbridge will work with refugees to identify employment that is sustainable and meaningful, including: individualised career and development planning, a development fund to support refugees to remove some of the barriers to employment (for example driver licensing fees, training opportunities), and engagement with employers and the private sector to reduce stigma and remove barriers to employing refugees."

        "main_content": "30 May 2024 7 minute read Deportation approach Immigration New Zealand (INZ) serves Deportation Liability Notices and Deportation Orders, where appropriate, to people who may be liable for deportation because of criminal activity or other public interest factors or being unlawfully in New Zealand. Most people depart voluntarily when we contact them. A voluntary departure does not preclude people returning to New Zealand if they are able to obtain the necessary visa, but this will depend on the individual circumstances. If people unlawfully in New Zealand choose not to cooperate and disengage from us, then they risk being deported in much the same way as higher priority deportations and face a prohibition of up to 5 years on returning to New Zealand as well as having to repay any costs associated with their deportation. In other cases where people are not unlawfully in New Zealand but are deported, they may face a prohibition of up to 5 years and in some cases a permanent prohibition on returning to New Zealand, as well as having to repay any costs associated with their deportation. INZ does not interact with New Zealand citizens being deported back to New Zealand as they have the legal right to enter the country, regardless of what they have done overseas. INZ prioritises compliance visits according to set criteria. Those engaged in criminality are the highest priority, starting with people who are a threat to national security. The other main priorities are: persons that are about to be released from prison persons that have come to the attention of Police for criminal conduct persons who have exhausted their pathways to remain in New Zealand: they have no avenues of appeal, or they have been determined to be a non-genuine refugee. INZ works closely with the Department of Corrections and other agencies to manage the cases of people who are in prison and who are liable for deportation on their release from prison. Deportations of non-residents People who stay in New Zealand longer than their visa allows are unlawfully in the country and are automatically liable for deportation. INZ may serve them with a Deportation Order once their appeal rights expire. Appeal rights begin on the day that the person becomes unlawful. In other cases where individuals are not unlawfully in New Zealand but there are grounds to make them liable for deportation (eg they have breached the conditions of their visa or have character issues), they will be served with a Deportation Liability Notice (DLN). This is the first stage in the deportation process and activates their appeal rights. In most cases, people have 42 days from the date they became liable for deportation to appeal against deportation on humanitarian grounds to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal (IPT) after first becoming unlawful. During this appeal period they cannot be deported from the country unless they agree to waive their appeal rights. A DLN will provide information about any applicable appeal rights and periods. There is no time limit on deporting non-residents and it is standard practice for people convicted of serious criminal offences to be deported after a prison term. Deportations of residents An individual who is a New Zealand resident who is convicted of a criminal offence could become liable for deportation under section 161 of the Immigration Act 2009. Liability depends on when the person first held a residence class visa, the date of the offending and the sentence received or potential sentence the Court could give. There are 3 main tiers under section 161: The first is when a New Zealand resident commits an offence and that offending occurred while they were unlawfully in New Zealand, held a temporary visa or within 2 years of being granted residence. The offence must be one which the Court has the power to impose imprisonment for a term of 3 months or more. They do not have to be sentenced to 3 months but the Court must have the power to impose 3 months or more. The second is when a New Zealand resident commits an offence and that offending occurred within the first 5 years of holding residence and the Court has the power to impose imprisonment for a term of 2 years or more. They do not have to be sentenced to 2 years but the Court must have the power to impose 2 years or more. The third is when a New Zealand resident commits an offence and that offending occurred within 10 years of being granted residence. The Court must impose imprisonment for a term of 5 years or more for a person to be liable under this tier. Apart from becoming liable for deportation on account of being convicted for criminal offending, a residence class visa holder may also be made liable for deportation where INZ determines that the person had obtained residence due to having committed immigration fraud. For example, this could be providing false information in a visa application, or if new information regarding the person’s character becomes available.

Self-deportation — A person who is unlawfully in New Zealand who departs New Zealand of their own volition and at no cost to the Ministry after the date when the person may be served with a deportation order, but they have not been served with such an order. Voluntary departure — A person who is unlawfully in New Zealand or is a temporary visa holder who was made liable for deportation and departs of their own volition and at no cost to the Ministry prior to the date when the person may be served with a deportation order. Note There was a noticeable drop in the number of deportations in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 financial years because of the impact of COVID-19. People who have overstayed their visa Our latest estimate from 2017 indicates that there were approximately 14,000 migrants without valid visas in New Zealand at that time. The accuracy of data about those who have overstayed their visa is limited, as the data is influenced by several factors including inconsistencies between border movement and visa validity, historical data entry issues and missing and inaccurate border movements or both. Most people who have overstayed their visa are aged between 25 and 64. The majority were previously on a visitor visa (60%). Pacific nationals (Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Tuvalu and Kiribati) make up around a third of the total estimate.

        "main_content": "Online jobs boards A number of specialist New Zealand websites work with employers seeking skilled workers overseas. These sites specifically target skilled people overseas and are great places to start if you’re serious about recruiting from abroad. Depending on your industry, it is likely there are specialist websites overseas that target people with the skills you are seeking. Mainstream job boards such as Seek and TradeMe are visited by workers offshore looking for jobs in New Zealand. These sites are very popular so they often appear near the top of searches. Some job sites say that offshore applicants will require either New Zealand residence or a valid work visa. This is not correct. Anyone can apply for a job, however they cannot work without a valid work or residence visa. Both you and any migrant applicants should fully understand the likely visa requirements, costs and timing, and that any employment agreement would be dependent on a successful visa application. Your business website Your business website is a great tool for attracting overseas candidates. It is a good idea to include a specific careers page which lists your vacancies (including detailed job descriptions). This will ensure that you receive ongoing search traffic from people looking for opportunities in your industry and also provide a good place to link to in any overseas marketing activity. Other things you should consider including on your website include: A section for international applicants. If there are online application forms, are these suitable for offshore applications? For example is there space for a foreign address with country and zip code fields? Check that your site content does not exclude those people who do not have a work visa from applying. LinkedIn LinkedIn is the largest global jobs marketplace for professionals. It allows you to promote your roles online and target people based on criteria such as country, age, occupation, technical skills and years of experience.

What experience do you have that is relevant to this role? \n \n Here are some tips to help you communicate clearly with your migrant candidate: Communicating clearly across cultures does not require you to speak slowly. This can appear patronising. Your migrant candidate may have been studying or speaking English for many years but may not be familiar with New Zealand English or our accent. They will, however, become familiar with it over time. So try to chunk your language to assist with clarity. This means speaking at normal speed but stressing important words in each chunk: Tell me | about a time | when you have | dealt with | conflict at work. Body language can vary across cultures. For example, in some cultures, nodding your head can mean ‘no’ and shaking your head can mean ‘yes’. In many cultures, people of opposite genders do not shake hands, while in other places, a firm handshake is considered rude. Some migrant candidates may be unaware of these differences and may, for example, give a weak handshake or avoid eye contact. Think about how your own gestures could be interpreted differently from what you may intend. Ask one question at a time, rather than a question with many embedded questions. Give the candidate enough time to think about their answer and respond. Humour does not translate well across cultures. Our humour may even offend in some cultures. You should be warm and polite, but making jokes is not advisable in a job interview. Do not assume that the candidate has fully understood your question. Check their understanding. Simply stating “I’m happy to repeat anything that’s not clear” is often enough to prompt the migrant candidate to ask for clarification if they do not understand. Immigration New Zealand has developed Keeping it Clear, a resource containing advice about how to communicate effectively with migrant audiences. Many of the tips can be applied to job interviews.

For example, behavioural interviewing is not commonly used in some parts of the world.",
        "main_content": "In behavioural interviews, candidates are expected to provide structured answers to open-ended questions. Many interviewers expect STAR-based answers, especially employers in the New Zealand government sector. The STAR model: S ituation - Describe the situation or problem. \n T ask - Describe the task that the situation required. \n A ction - Describe the action taken. \n R esult - Highlight the results achieved Many migrants may not have come across this kind of question structure before and may not know the best way to respond to an open-ended question. While everyone needs to prepare well for a job interview, there are still things you can do to help get the best from migrant job candidates. Here are some tips for interviewing migrant candidates: Clearly state to the candidate your expectations regarding the answers they give, preferably at the start of the interview. Explain that you want to hear about a specific example from their past if you are using the behavioural interviewing technique. Be flexible enough to rephrase a question if you do not get the kind of answer you are looking for. Be patient and give the candidate time to think and respond. Let them quickly note down their ideas on a piece of paper if it would help them to organise their thoughts before answering. Prompt the candidate to provide a complete and structured answer to an open-ended question if they answer in an unsatisfactory way. A way to do this is to paraphrase the candidate’s answer to fit the STAR model, or prompt the candidate to finish their STAR answer, e.g. \n \n ‘What was the end result?’ Remember that for migrants from cultures where saving face is important, it may be difficult for them to answer questions relating to failure, such as \n \n ‘Tell me about a time when something did not go well at work’. \n \n Read more about the STAR interview technique"

These include creating a positive environment, showing empathy, using effective questions and helping candidates with their responses.",
        "main_content": "The following strategies have been identified and tested by interviewers and migrant job seekers, drawing on the analysis of authentic interactions by the Language in the Workplace Project team, Victoria University of Wellington. 1. Create a positive environment Small talk at the start of the interview can help the candidate feel at ease: \"Thank you for coming to talk with us today.\" Explain the background to the interview process and the purpose of the questions asked: \"Today we will be using ‘behavioural’ interview questions. This means that we want to hear about specific examples from your past.\" Explain the process of the interviewer writing notes: \"I will write a few things down as we talk. Don’t pay attention to me; I am still listening to your answers.\" Value work experience gained overseas, as detailed in their CV: \"I see you had a similar job in Singapore. Would you mind telling me about it?\" Show genuine interest in their background and ask non-scripted questions which relate to their CV: \"Looking at your CV, I see that you have certainly had a lot of international experience. Which country did you prefer?\" \n \n 2. Show empathy If the candidate seems to be struggling with their answer, consider providing support: Candidate: \"Sorry, I am stuck.\" Interviewer: \"That’s fine, take all the time you need.\" Repeat and respond positively to the end of their answer. Candidate: \"And I worked there for ten years.\" Interviewer: \"Ten years, that's a long time!\" \n 3. Use effective questions Make links between your questions to help the candidate follow your point: \"This leads me on to my next question...\" Explain the purpose of the question: \"I'm asking you about how you deal with conflict at work to see whether you can deal with normal levels of workplace stress effectively and professionally.\" Explain the question with some background information about the working environment: \"The reason I ask this is that in New Zealand you will be expected to cover a number of roles. We may not have the same level of support as you expect. Have you got an example of how you worked with a small team?\" Elaborate your questions in a number of ways. Rephrase the question rather than repeating it if the candidate looks like they do not understand: \"What would you bring to the position? I mean, what skills have you got that would suit this job?\" Explain what you are really looking for. Ask the candidate to try again, giving them a possible scenario: \"That's a good answer about working with a tight timeframe. But I was asking for an example of when you had to persuade a client. For example, when you had to get an external client on your side.\" Explain the vocabulary you use in a question: \"Tell me about a time when you showed initiative at work, for example, when you had an idea and suggested a new way of doing something.\" Clarify the question when the candidate has started off on the wrong track, rather than waiting until they have finished their answer: \"Actually, I'm not sure that you fully understood my question. I would like to hear about a specific time when you dealt with pressure, and what you did about it.\" Give the candidate the opportunity to add more to their answer: \"Any other strengths?\" Give the candidate the opportunity to say more about themselves: \"I have asked a lot of questions. Is there something else you would like to tell me about yourself, that I haven't asked?\" Make the interview more like a conversation by asking probing questions that build on the candidate’s responses, rather than moving onto the next scripted question: Candidate: \"... the clients were very happy.\" Interviewer: \"So why were they happy?\" Candidate: \"Because we produced the materials on time.\" Interviewer: \"What sort of materials.\" Acknowledge that non-native English speaking candidates might find it difficult to respond to questions about negative experiences or to disclose negative aspects of themselves. Explain why the question is important in New Zealand and what kind of answer you expect: \"I'm asking about your weaknesses because it's important for me to see if you are open to feedback and aware of where you could improve.\" \n \n 4. Help candidates with their responses Persevere with the candidate to get them to answer the question more precisely: Interviewer: \"Why does working at the museum appeal to you?\" Candidate: \"It's a friendly place. A nice environment to work in.\" Interviewer: \"So is that why you applied for this job?\" Avoid a question where the implication is not stated: Interviewer: \"What about the museum interests you most?\" Candidate: \"Sorry, what about the museum? The exhibits or the facilities?\" Interviewer: \"I mean, is there something about working in the museum that interests you professionally and could be an area you would like to focus on?\" Acknowledge relevant evidence even if it is in an answer to another question: \"You mentioned that you managed a team of three people. This is very relevant to the supervisory experience I mentioned earlier.\" Use encouraging body language, such as smiling and nodding. Use encouraging phrases: \"Oh right. Yeah. Absolutely.\""

        "main_content": "Who you can make a job offer to You can make a job offer to someone who does not have a work visa but the offer should be conditional on the applicant getting the appropriate work or residence class visa. This is similar to making the offer conditional on reference checks or medical tests. They must not start working for you until they have a work or residence class visa. If you find a candidate who requires a visa to be able to start working for you, they will need a little more time for the visa to be arranged and may need some assistance from you.

Employer Supplementary Form (INZ 1113) PDF 487KB What to include in a job offer Job offer documentation should include: the employer’s name, address and contact details the prospective employee’s name and address an employment agreement including a job description and person specification, detailing: the job title or designation the address of the place of employment the type of work, duties and responsibilities of the job the pay and employment conditions, such as holidays and sick leave confirmation the job offer is for full-time employment (at least 30 hours a week) qualifications and experience required and confirmation of whether or not registration in New Zealand is required the duration of the job how long the job offer is open for. The offer must meet the requirements of New Zealand employment laws and pay an appropriate market rate. The job offer must be current when we assess the migrant’s application. Employment agreement builder Managing your migrant employee’s expectations It is important to manage your migrant employee’s expectations, including how long the visa process will take. Some factors, like how long a Police Check takes, are outside of your, their or Immigration New Zealand’s control. Make sure your migrant employee’s expectations about the job and what life in New Zealand will be like are as close as possible to reality. Remember, applicants from overseas are not just starting a new job but a new life in a new country. If they have a partner or children, this also adds complexity. If they get here and things are not as they expected they may not stay. Talk to your candidates about what they need to take care of before they can leave their current home country – a common understanding at this stage will reduce stress all round and show you are a considerate employer. It’s also helpful to have a plan for settling your migrant staff when they get here. Preparing for your migrant staff"

Increase to minimum pay From 1 October 2023 you must pay all your RSE workers the minimum wage rate plus 10%. This applies to all RSE workers linked to an existing ATR and who hold a valid RSE Limited Visa, including those workers granted RSE Limited Visas before 1 October 2023. If you do not pay RSE workers the new rate as of 1 October 2023, you will breach the ATR requirements. Hourly rate from 1 October From 1 October 2023, the minimum hourly rate for all RSE workers will increase to $24.97 (New Zealand minimum wage $22.70 + 10%). To avoid delays, you may choose to start updating your employment agreement templates with the new hourly rate (and to allow for future changes to minimum wage). Here is an example of what you could add into your employment agreement template: The employee will be paid no less than $24.97 per hour (or the minimum hourly rate for RSE employees as directed by RSE Instructions). Weekly wage — minimum remuneration 30 hours With the increase to the minimum hourly rate, the RSE minimum weekly wage will also increase from 1 October. Table 1 shows the before and after 1 October weekly wage amounts. Table 1: Before and after 1 October weekly wage amounts Date Calculation method Minimum remuneration — RSE worker weekly wage Before 1 October 2023 RSE wage rate ($22.70) × 30 hours $681.00 From 1 October 2023 RSE wage rate ($24.97) × 30 hours $749.10 If your employment agreement states that pay to the worker will be by piece rate, you must pay them at least the minimum weekly wage (30 hours × RSE wage rate). If the total weekly payment (excluding 8% holiday pay), based on piece rates, results in less than the minimum weekly wage, you must top it up. If the payment based on piece rates is more than the minimum weekly wage, a top up is not required. When your employment agreement specifies a rate per hour higher than the minimum RSE wage rate, calculate the minimum weekly wage using the rate specified in your employment agreement. When there is a joint ATR, the worker must be paid in line with the ‘per hour’ rate specified in each employment agreement for a minimum of 30 hours per week. Minimum remuneration requirements in employment agreements Employment agreements that are 6 weeks or more The minimum remuneration for an agreement of 6 weeks or more is the greater of the following amounts: payment at no less than 240 hours at the 'per hour' rate, regardless of the actual availability of work, or payment for a minimum of 30 hours per week at the 'per hour' rate for the period worked. Employment agreements that are less than 6 weeks The minimum remunerations for an employment agreement of less than 6 weeks is payment for 40 hours per week, at the 'per hour' rate, over the period of work offered in the agreement. This is regardless of the actual availability of work. Providing sick leave entitlement from 1 October From 1 October 2023 you will be required to provide your RSE workers granted a RSE Limited Visa from 1 October 2023 (eligible RSE workers) paid sick leave entitlement. This change is in line with the changes proposed by Holidays Act Taskforce in their review of the Holidays Act 2003. \n Holidays Act review Paid sick leave entitlement for eligible RSE workers means: giving them 2 days paid sick leave from their first day of employment and an additional 2 days each month until they reach a total entitlement of 10 days’ sick leave on their 4-month anniversary, and recording the new sick leave entitlement in written employment agreements. For example, if an eligible RSE employee starts their employment on 10 October 2023 their entitlement to paid sick leave will look like this: Table 2: How paid sick leave entitlement accumulates Date Sick leave entitlement 10 October 2023 — day 1 2 days 10 November 2023 2 days 10 December 2023 2 days 10 January 2024 2 days 10 February 2024 2 days 10 March 2024 Full entitlement provided 10 April 2024 Full entitlement provided Note From 1 October 2023, you are also required to pay workers at least the minimum wage + 10% for hours worked. Providing sick leave entitlement to RSE workers granted a visa before 1 October 2023 RSE workers granted RSE limited visas before 1 October 2023 will not be required to: receive the new sick leave entitlement, or have the new sick leave entitlement included in their employment agreements. You can choose to provide the new sick leave entitlement to your RSE workers granted an RSE limited visa before 1 October 2023. If you do, you should: record this in writing make sure the affected workers know they can get the new sick leave entitlement consider providing an entitlement to paid sick leave using the table 3 example. Table 3: An example of providing paid sick leave entitlement to an RSE worker who started on a 9 month employment agreement on 1 August 2023 Date Paid sick leave entitlement 1 October 2023 4 days 1 November 2023 2 days 1 December 2023 2 days 1 January 2024 2 days 1 February 2024 Full entitlement of 10 days provided 1 March 2024 - 1 April 2024 — last month of 9 month contract - Incorporating new paid sick leave entitlement into payroll systems Every electronic payroll system will have different functionality for accurately recording and providing the new sick leave entitlement to eligible RSE workers. If you use a payroll system discuss the options within the system with your payroll provider. The options available in a payroll system could include: the addition of the new sick leave entitlement type specifically for RSE workers if the payroll provider can implement system changes by 1 October 2023 using an additional leave or payment type currently within the system (for example, a contractual leave type). Where possible, this leave should be clearly noted as ‘RSE sick leave’ (or similar) in the system to distinguish it from other types of leave or payments, including any leave provided in advance of entitlement using ‘sick leave in advance’ as the relevant leave type if this is the only option available in the system. Manual process when using 'sick leave in advance' or similar option Where using 'sick leave in advance', or a similar option, you will need to have a manual process in place to ensure: 2 days of sick leave is added to eligible RSE workers’ sick leave entitlement balances from their first day of employment. Then an additional 2 days of sick leave is added to that balance on completion of each month. This continues until a total of 10 days’ sick leave has been provided to the worker upon the completion of 4 months of employment, and when an eligible RSE worker’s employment ends that payments for the new sick leave entitlement are not deducted from the worker’s final pay, regardless of whether there is a general deduction clause in the employment agreement (or some other form of written consent has been obtained from the worker). Sick leave entitlement record keeping for eligible RSE workers Regardless of the payroll system you use, you should ensure that your record keeping relating to the sick leave entitlement for eligible RSE workers is accurate and complete. This is likely to involve: recording or flagging in your payroll system those workers who are eligible RSE workers ensuring that 2 days of sick leave is added to eligible RSE workers’ sick leave entitlement balances from the first day of employment, with an additional 2 days of sick leave added to their balances on completion of each month. This is until a total of 10 days’ sick leave has been accumulated for each eligible RSE worker who has completed 4 months of employment. recording the date and the amount paid when an eligible RSE worker takes a day of paid sick leave that they are entitled to receive under their employment agreement implementing any manual processes or work arounds required if your payroll system does not have the functionality to record the entitlement or payments (for the new sick leave entitlement). Keeping accurate records — Employment New Zealand Paying the new sick leave entitlement Payment should be an amount that is equivalent to the RSE worker’s 'relevant daily pay (RDP)' or 'average daily pay (ADP)' (if applicable). What is Relevant Daily Pay? — Employment New Zealand PDF 241KB Relevant daily pay vs average daily pay — Employment New Zealand PDF 416KB Eligible RSE workers who leave before completing 4 months of employment When an eligible RSE worker leaves before completing 4 months of employment, check if they have been paid sick leave: during their employment that they were entitled to under their employment agreement, or ‘in advance’ of entitlement. Your payroll system should have the functionality to manage the new sick leave entitlement for eligible RSE workers and distinguish payments for the entitlement from other types of leave (or payments). If not, put in place a manual process to check whether sick leave paid to the worker was: payment they were entitled to under their employment agreement, or provided ‘in advance’ of entitlement. When to deduct from the worker's final pay Deductions are allowed, in line with with the Wages Protection Act 1983. For example, an eligible RSE worker starts work with you on 1 October. They leave before completing 2 months with you. In that time they took 5 days of paid of sick leave, 4 days of the sick leave was leave they were entitled to. You treat as sick leave ‘in advance’ their fifth day of paid sick leave. In the example, while there is no provision in the Holidays Act to recover sick leave in advance, you may deduct 1 day of sick leave from the worker's final pay if you: complied with the Wages Protection Act 1983 and the RSE requirements for employment agreements, and made sure your employee was paid at least the minimum remuneration for the week sick leave in advance was taken in line with RSE requirements. Deductions under the Wages Protection Act 1983 — Employment New Zealand website RSE requirements for employment agreements and minimum remuneration 'Paying out' unused sick leave entitlement to an eligible RSE worker who ends their employment There is no requirement to pay out any balance of the new sick leave entitlement."

The Unit works closely with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), the UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and foreign governments. Refugee resettlement strategy We coordinate our work for refugees under the New Zealand Refugee Resettlement Strategy. The vision of this strategy is that former refugees and their families settle successfully, achieve their goals, and thrive in Aotearoa New Zealand. This includes feeling safe and well, having a sense of belonging and being able to participate in and contribute to all aspects of life (social, economic, cultural, and civic). The vision is underpinned by 5 settlement outcomes: Participation and Inclusion: Former refugees and their families are welcomed and have a strong sense of belonging and acceptance in their communities and in Aotearoa New Zealand. They feel confident and safe to participate in different aspects of their lives. Health and Wellbeing: Former refugees and their families achieve their health and wellbeing goals and thrive in their lives. Housing: Former refugees and their families live in homes and in communities that meet their long-term needs and goals. Education, Training and English Language: Former refugees and their families achieve their education, training and English language goals. Employment and Self-Sufficiency: Former refugees and their families achieve their employment and self-sufficiency goals, building on their skills and experiences.

Factsheets for refugees and their families settling in New Zealand Videos for refugees and their families settling in New Zealand Refugee quota programme New Zealand’s Refugee Quota Programme resettles 1,500 refugees each year. More information on the Refugee Quota Programme Community Organisation Refugee Sponsorship Category The Community Organisation Refugee Sponsorship (CORS) category pilot enables New Zealand-based community organisations to sponsor refugees for resettlement. The CORS category is complementary to the annual Refugee Quota Programme. A CORS category pilot ran in 2018, allowing 4 approved community organisation sponsors to settle 24 sponsored refugees. The community organisations actively supported sponsored refugees to settle in New Zealand and prepared their communities to welcome refugees. Overall, the pilot helped promote community involvement and inclusion, supporting refugees to become active participants in New Zealand society. In May 2020, the Government agreed to extend the CORS category pilot for a further 3 years from 1 July 2021. This will allow up to 50 sponsored refugees to be resettled in New Zealand in each of the 3 financial years from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2024 (a total of 150 sponsored refugees over the 3 years). Sponsored refugees will be supported to settle by approved community organisations. Principal applicants must be: mandated refugees , and sponsored by one of the 4 approved community organisations. From 14 September 2023, any partner or dependent child included in a residence application no longer have to be mandated refugees, but are counted in the cap of 150 people approved under the CORS category. INZ has received sufficient expressions of interest to meet capacity under the CORS category. For this reason, further expressions of interest are no longer being accepted. In early 2021, Immigration New Zealand (INZ) worked collaboratively with refugees, previous sponsor organisations, iwi partners and key stakeholders to co-design a community architecture or model to support the delivery of the extended CORS category. The new model includes the addition of an umbrella organisation (HOST Aotearoa New Zealand) to support both refugees and community groups through the settlement journey. Extended CORS pilot project estimated timeline Early 2021: Community engagement and design phase in relation to the community organisation support model starts. From mid-2021: Implementation of the community organisation support model. Last quarter of 2021: Applications from potential community organisations estimated to open.

Settlement information New Zealand offers a chance for refugees to build a life in a new land. Refugees must adjust to their new country and the communities in which they will live. While there is extensive help from NGOs and government agencies to help them settle, they must also learn to make the most of living in New Zealand. INZ has a useful website that describes life in New Zealand called Live and Work New Zealand. Live and Work New Zealand is a guide to living and working in New Zealand. It includes sections on how to find work and how to present yourself in a job interview. The site has information on studying in New Zealand.

Funding is allocated to government agencies that have expertise in specific areas of migrant settlement. The settlement services may be delivered either by the government agency, or by a third-party provider. Settlement services Identifying settlement funding priorities Our Strategy Inter-agency Reference Group determines settlement funding priorities and provides advice to a group of senior government officials and then to ministers. Final decisions on where funding is allocated are made by relevant ministers. Reaching cross-agency agreement on funding priorities and service delivery involves a number of steps. We identify service and information gaps and areas of need across the 5 Strategy outcome areas, based on: consultations with recent migrants and settlement sector stakeholders recent trends in the Strategy’s 16 outcome indicators the contribution of current settlement services to the Strategy outcomes. We identify settlement information and services needed to fill information gaps and complement existing services. We assess and prioritise proposals, based on: how well they support the Strategy outcomes and indicators how well they contribute to an effective mix of services ensuring they do not duplicate any other government activity or service provided by other organisations opportunities for collaboration and partnering value for money feasibility, including cost, the design and implementation plan and the agency's capacity to deliver it the framework for monitoring and evaluating the contribution to the Strategy outcomes. National migrant consultations How we support migrants How we measure success Funding sources Funding sources for migrant settlement services include: Crown funding The Immigration Levy Accrued Migrant Levy revenue Pre-purchased English language tuition (PELT). \n \n How the funding is used Crown funding Crown funding supports established settlement services and access to mainstream services that migrants are eligible for, such as healthcare and education. Crown funding also helps us to provide information, tools and resources tailored to the needs of recent migrants and their employers. Immigration Levy The Immigration Levy supports settlement services that align with the Strategy outcomes, specifically benefit migrants and have an established evidence base. This levy was introduced in 2015 to replace the former Migrant Levy. Migrants pay this levy when applying for their visa. There is $7.757 million Immigration Levy revenue available annually for settlement services provided across government agencies. Cabinet makes decisions on the allocation of Immigration Levy funding for settlement every 4 years. Accrued Migrant Levy revenue The Accrued Migrant Levy supports one-off, short-term and small-scale settlement initiatives. This levy allows us to respond to migrants’ settlement needs in the period between Cabinet considerations of longer term Immigration Levy or Crown settlement funding allocations. It is a small amount of revenue that continued to accrue in 2016/17 after the new Immigration Levy replaced the Migrant Levy in 2015. This funding is no longer continuing to accrue. Pre-purchased English Language Tuition (PELT) Some migrants are required to pre-purchase English language tuition before arriving in New Zealand to help them meet minimum English requirements for residence. The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) is responsible for administering PELT funds. Migrants must use their PELT funds at a tertiary education organisation approved by the TEC.

        "main_content": "What people trafficking means People trafficking is the process of moving someone using coercion or deception, or so they can be badly exploited. People trafficking can take place across borders or entirely within a country. What is people trafficking? Information for the community and government PDF 2MB People trafficking does not only happen to migrants, though migrants can be particularly vulnerable due to their reliance on others for visas, jobs or money, or their unfamiliarity with local laws, customs and languages. Migrant victims in particular are often tricked with false promises of jobs or schooling then badly exploited once they arrive in New Zealand. Exploitation can include being forced to work by threats of violence, threats of deportation or to repay debts. This work can include sex work, domestic work like cooking and cleaning or work in a restaurant, shop or labouring. Victims do not usually realise they have been trafficked and may blame themselves for getting themselves into a dangerous situation. Sometimes people agree to their initial movement and some degree of exploitation only to find out once they are unable to leave or resist, that the actual situation is much worse than they expected. Check if you are in a trafficking situation Are you in a trafficking situation? Ask yourself: has someone taken your passport and money? are there locks on your doors or windows to stop you from leaving your workplace or where you live? do you need to ask permission to eat, sleep or go to the toilet? do you have no time off, for example, to go shopping and meet other people? does your employer pay you low wages or none at all? does your employer force you to work to pay off debt? has someone threatened you or your family with violence, jail or deportation if you do not cooperate? have you travelled or been recruited for work that has turned out to be illegal, paid less than you were promised or not paid at all? A person may need help if they: live at their place of work – look for locks on the outside of doors have ‘rehearsed’ statements and stories do not have money or any form of ID because their passport is being withheld work long hours and have no time off have an ‘escort’ or ‘translator’ who speaks on their behalf have an unusual fear of their employer and authorities show signs of neglected mental or physical health with the possibility of substance abuse or self-harm.

The assessment is to see whether you can be certified as a victim of people trafficking by New Zealand Police (NZ Police). The certification process is done by Immigration New Zealand and NZ Police. You do not apply to be certified as a victim of people trafficking. If NZ Police certify you as a victim of people trafficking, you (or the person you reported on behalf of) can access support services in New Zealand that may not otherwise have been available. Support services for certified victims of people trafficking Access to Victim Support services is available for: New Zealand citizens or residents, and non-residents of New Zealand if the crime occurred in New Zealand. The New Zealand Government is committed to eliminating people trafficking and protecting victims, including those victims who may have breached their visas or who are in New Zealand unlawfully. Visas for victims of people trafficking Police-certified victims of people trafficking can apply for special visas that allow them to stay in New Zealand and work, study or live here permanently in some cases. Trafficking Victim Work Visa Trafficking Child Victim Student Visa Trafficking Child Victim Visitor Visa Trafficking Victim Resident Visa Healthcare for victims of people trafficking Police-certified victims of people trafficking are eligible to receive publically funded healthcare under Section B12 of the Ministry of Health’s Eligibility Direction. Health and Disability Services Eligibility Direction 2011 Welfare support for victims of people trafficking Police-certified victims of people trafficking may be eligible for welfare support, administered by the Ministry of Social Development, under Clause 15E of the Special Needs Grants Programme. Clause 15E. Victims of people trafficking | Work and Income Migrant exploitation Exploitation is not always connected to people trafficking but exploitation alone can have significant impacts on victims. Migrant exploitation There is a special work visa available for migrants who have been exploited by their employer, even if they have not been trafficked. This is called the Migrant Exploitation and Protection Work Visa. Migrant Exploitation and Protection Work Visa"

        "main_content": "The system is secure Immigration New Zealand has engaged external online security experts to provide quality assurance, and the project has built in security considerations throughout the design, build and deployment. Applicants and third parties such as immigration agents and education institutions require a RealMe logon to gain access to Immigration Online. RealMe is the Government’s online identity verification service - it’s the secure way for New Zealanders to access services and prove their identity online. Once access is granted, there is a further layer of security that determines what the logged-in user can see and do. Your privacy is protected Protecting client privacy is a key Immigration Online design principle. Immigration Online collects and uses the same sort of information that INZ currently collects from clients on paper application forms. The difference with Immigration Online is that information collected is securely stored electronically rather than on paper. Immigration New Zealand carries out an ongoing comprehensive Privacy Impact Assessment of all parts of Immigration Online to ensure ‘privacy by design’ remains a core feature of the new system. The system uses biometrics – that is, information that uniquely distinguishes one person from another, such as photographs and fingerprints. Security features built into the system protects against unauthorised users accessing information that would compromise personal privacy. The information submitted as part of an application is only viewable to the submitter and INZ. However, applications may be shared with other users of the system by those who have authorised access, who will then have visibility of information submitted as part of the application. This sharing requires multiple-factor authentication to prevent the release of private information. Read more about how INZ protects privacy"

They are under an obligation to leave New Zealand and are liable for deportation under the Immigration Act 2009. A person who is unlawfully in New Zealand has no lawful ability to make an application for a further visa. Section 61 of the Act provides the Minister of Immigration (delegated to the Associate Minister of Immigration and to senior immigration officers) with the power, in his or her absolute discretion, to grant a visa of any type to a person unlawfully in New Zealand and otherwise liable for deportation (unless they are subject to a deportation order). If an unlawful person requests a visa under section 61, there is no obligation to consider the request or make any further inquiries. INZ has established a dedicated team of senior immigration officers to deal with section 61 requests. When a request is considered, the Act specifically states that the decision maker is not required to give reasons for the decision.  The person who made the request is also not able to access any recorded reasons under the Official Information Act or Privacy Act.

        "main_content": "14 February 2024 3 minute read Immigration staff are in regular contact with ethnic community leaders, and one common question is what advice we can give people, so they do not get taken advantage of by unscrupulous individuals looking to profit off peoples’ desires to work in New Zealand. Senior Investigator Helen Garratt says immigration scams are nothing new but with the rise of social media including apps like WhatsApp it is easy for people to get pulled into a scam. “The general rule is if someone offers you a job in New Zealand and it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. However, there are a few hallmarks of scams that people can look out for in order to protect themselves. “An employer or a recruiter cannot charge you for a job. So beware of offers asking you to pay a large sum of money in return for a visa and a job. Also, paying a sum to have your visa application fast-tracked is another sign the offer could be a scam.\" “Be careful around job offers promising you will earn an unrealistically high wage or that the job will be a pathway to residency in New Zealand. If they can, people should check directly with the employer that the job offer they have received is genuine,” says Ms Garratt. INZ’s advice, for people who wish to work in New Zealand, is to apply through approved pathways rather than via third party agents using apps. “All visa fees are on the immigration website and are far below the cost we are seeing scammers ask migrant workers to pay for the same visa, for instance an Accredited Employer Work Visa for someone applying from India is NZD $750,” says Ms Garratt. Fees, decision times and where to apply If people need help with their New Zealand visa we recommend they seek advice from a licensed immigration adviser (LIA), or other approved adviser. Immigration advice for your visa application Avoid the pitfalls of receiving illegal immigration advice. Unlicensed people may not be honest with you or INZ. INZ may not accept a visa application from unlicensed people acting illegally. You can learn more on the IAA website. For migrants — IAA The \"Guide to licensed immigration advisers\" has more information and is available in multiple languages, including Hindi, Punjabi, Chinese, Korean, Samoan, Tongan and Taglish on the IAA website. Guides and resources — IAA It is important to remember that migrant workers have the same minimum employment rights as New Zealand workers.

From 13 April, the Spain WHS annual quota will increase from 200 to 2,000 places, and Spain WHS visa holders will be able to work for the full 12-month duration of their visa (currently, visa holders must not work for more than 6 months in total and must not work for the same employer for more than 3 months). There will also be a 6-month extension by special direction to WHS visa holders currently in New Zealand whose visa expires between 4 April and 30 September (inclusive). This change will help to address current workforce shortages, particularly in industries which traditionally employ open work visa holders such as tourism and hospitality.

        "main_content": "18 October 2023 6 minute read Stopping the use of 90-day trial periods From 29 October, accredited employers are not able to use 90-day trial periods in employment agreements when hiring people on an Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV). This is to encourage accredited employers to treat migrant fairly, and only recruit someone when they have a genuine labour need or skills gap to fill. Employment agreements provided with job check applications must not include a trial period. Employers who use a trial period in employment agreements will risk having their accreditation revoked. Breaches could be detected up front as part of the Job Check process, or through post-decision and re-accreditation checks. Who does it apply to? From 29 October, an employer’s AEWV Job Check application under assessment will be declined if it includes an employment agreement with a trial period (regardless of the submission date), or Immigration New Zealand (INZ) may request updated information. This includes Job Checks submitted before 29 October 2023 but assessed on and after this date. The 90-day trial rule will not apply to: applications based on already-approved Job Checks, or migrants who already hold, or have applied for, an AEWV based on a job check that was approved prior to 29 October 2023 (when the policy takes effect). Clarification of the ability to suspend or revoke an employer’s accreditation under the AEWV Additionally, technical updates have been made to immigration instructions to clarify the ability to suspend or revoke an employer’s accreditation under the AEWV. From 29 October: an employer’s accreditation can be suspended when INZ or another regulator is taking active steps to confirm an employer or its key people are compliant with immigration, employment and business standards. This includes any verification or compliance activities – not just formal investigations., the requirement for accredited employers not to pass on certain costs to migrant workers includes passing on costs to visa applicants, as well as those who already hold a visa. AEWV Labour hire (triangular) employment threshold change From 27 November 2023, we will be requiring accredited employers who are labour hire (triangular) employment firms who place migrants in specific construction occupations to have at least 35% of their labour hire workforce made up of New Zealand citizens and residents in full time employment. This is an increase from the current threshold of 15%. We will now assess the New Zealand workforce threshold at both the accreditation and Job Check stages. Job Checks will fail if the new threshold is not met. Existing employers will not lose their current accreditation if they don't meet the new 35% threshold, as long as they continue to meet the 15% threshold. However, we will not approve a further Job Check until they meet the new threshold. The increased threshold will only apply to labour hire employers who are placing, or intending to place, AEWV holders in the following occupations: Bricklayer Builder’s labourer Building insulation installer Carpenter Carpenter and joiner Concreter Construction rigger Crane chaser Drainage, sewerage and stormwater labourer Driller’s assistant Earthmoving labourer Fencer Fibrous plasterer Fitter (General) Floor finisher Glazier Home improvement installer Joiner Lagger Linemaker Metal fabricator Painting trades worker Paving and surfacing labourer Plumber’s assistant Railway track worker Roof plumber Roof tiler Scaffolder Solid plasterer Steel Fixer Stonemason Structural steel erector Surveyor’s assistant Wall and floor tiler You are a triangular employer if: You are employing staff for the purposes of placing or assigning the employee with a controlling third party. It is ‘triangular’ because there are three parties to an employment arrangement, with each party having distinct relationships with one another. Checks for employers with incorrect accreditation are underway. Find out more about the changes here: \n NZ workforce requirements for the construction sector AEWV processing times Immigration New Zealand (INZ) has made adjustments to our Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV) assessment approach. We are making more requests for further information from employers to confirm job vacancies are current, vacancies are genuine and whether employers can support the migrants they plan to hire. As a result, we are experiencing an increase in our processing times for the employer accreditation and job check phases of the Accredited Employer Work Visa (AEWV). Most applications are taking longer than 10 days to process at present. We recommend employers allow at least six weeks to apply for an accreditation and six weeks to apply for a job check with current processing times. We are working to improve these. Information on our current processing timeframes: \n How long it takes to process an application If an application has not yet been allocated for assessment and you need to request urgent allocation, employers can use the INZ employment visa escalation process to request that their application is prioritised if necessary. Note: an application taking longer than 10 days to process is not in itself a reason to be prioritised given the current volumes we are processing. Escalation for urgent applications How you can help Employer accreditation Immigration New Zealand needs to be satisfied you are a genuine and viable business. To help streamline the processing of your employer accreditation application, you may wish to upload evidence of your business’ financial position in the further evidence section of the application to demonstrate this. For example, profit and loss statements for the business that cover the last 24 months. Job checks If you have a Job Check application in progress If we have not yet made a decision on your Job Check application, you need to: Review the Job Check application and make sure that the employment agreement does not include a trial period. If the employment agreement includes a trial period, upload as soon as possible an updated employment agreement that does not include a trial period. This will help us to process the application more quickly. The Job Check application can be declined or will take longer to process if the employment agreement includes a trial period. If you are applying for a new Job Check Make sure the job check applications are for roles where there are current vacancies. Job check applications for future possible work are not allowed under immigration instructions. Make sure all required documentation is provided so the application is ready for a decision. If you are including multiple vacancies in one job check, include additional information to show these vacancies are genuine and your client can support the migrants they plan to hire. This could include: organisation charts contracts for ongoing work details on your migrant settlement support. This can be provided in the ‘further evidence’ section of the job check application.

        "main_content": "New Zealand contributes to international humanitarian efforts by helping protect people who are not able to live safely to their home country. Our government reviews the Refugee Quota Programme every 3 years to ensure it aligns with global resettlement needs. The composition of the refugee quota is agreed to annually by the Ministers of Immigration and Foreign Affairs. 2022/23 – 2024/25 Refugee Quota Programme New Zealand will continue to accept 1,500 refugees a year under the Refugee Quota Programme from 2022/23 to 2024/25. The proportion of places allocated to the Middle East and Africa international allocations has increased from 15% to 20% respectively, along with the number of emergency and urgent resettlement places (up from 35 to 100 people annually). Following the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, New Zealand set aside a number of places specifically for Afghan refugees to be resettled from 2023/24. The Government has decided to bring this forward a year to match referral capacity and support well managed settlement across communities in New Zealand. The number of places specifically allocated in 2022/23 for Afghan refugees is 200. Each year the Ministers of Immigration and Foreign Affairs allocate 200 places for resettlement from large scale emergencies. This allocation is within our annual quota of 1,500. In 2024/25 New Zealand will resettle 100 Syrian refugees and 100 Rohingya refugees. Refugees considered for resettlement under the programme (except certain applicants who are nuclear or dependent family members of the principal) must be recognised as mandated refugees and referred to New Zealand by UNHCR according to prescribed resettlement guidelines. When INZ processes and decides these cases the following factors are considered: INZ policy, credibility, settlement, security, immigration risk, and health. When refugees arrive in New Zealand Since World War II New Zealand has resettled over 35,000 refugees. The Government established a formal annual quota for the resettlement of refugees in 1987. The Refugee Quota Programme is a unit within the Refugee and Migrant Services Branch (RMS), a branch of Immigration New Zealand (INZ), tasked with operating the programme. INZ in turn sits within the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). Refugees who arrive in New Zealand under the Refugee Quota Programme are granted Permanent Residence status in New Zealand. They spend their first 2 weeks in New Zealand in managed isolation. They then transfer to Te Āhuru Mōwai o Aotearoa. The Centre is managed by INZ, which works in partnership with other government agencies and non-government organisations (NGO) to run the five-week reception programme. The reception programme prepares refugees for their new lives in New Zealand. Prior to arrival in New Zealand refugees are provided with information on working and living in New Zealand and an assessment is completed for each refugee to identify needs and services required once refugees arrive at the Centre. Settlement health assessments are also completed outside of New Zealand before arrival and any followed up by the medical team at the Centre. Key focus areas for the reception programme are: Health and mental health assessments, initial treatment and health promotion, and Settlement planning, including orientation to working and living in New Zealand and an employment assessment for working age refugees, and Education, including English language. Refugee children are also prepared for their introduction into the New Zealand classroom and national curriculum. After completing the reception programme, quota refugees are settled throughout New Zealand in: the Auckland region, Waikato, Manawatu, the Wellington region, Nelson, Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill. In June 2020 new resettlement locations Blenheim and Timaru received their first families of refugees. Ashburton, Levin and Masterton are also preparing to resettle refugees. Suitable housing is located for refugees prior to completion of the reception programme – either public housing or private rentals. In the community, quota refugees are provided settlement support for up to 12 months including a community orientation programme that complements the reception programme and support to link to services they require to support their settlement in communities."

These are the qualities we’re building on in a new two-year pilot programme called Welcoming Communities –Te waharoa ki ngā hapori. There are five regions piloting this programme. They are putting out the welcome mat to newcomers: migrants, former refugees and international students. This is happening in: Tauranga/Western Bay of Plenty Whanganui Palmerston North Ashburton/Selwyn, and Southland \n \n Mayor Grant Smith, Palmerston North: “Palmerston North is a very diverse city anyway. 120 different languages are spoken here – big Asian population… Indian – it just made sense”. Ahmed Hassan, Newcomer (Egypt): “Everyone says hi and waves to you: how are you today? There is a very nice attitude in Palmerston North”. Mayor Hamish McDouall, Whanganui: “Whanganui is famous for its Maanakitanga and we really want a diverse community here, it really adds to the flavour and also we’ve got capacity: we have great schools which need pupils, we’ve got relatively cheap housing all over the place”. Welcoming Communities is an Immigration New Zealand initiative, in partnership with the pilot councils, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Office of Ethnic Communities and the New Zealand Human Rights Commission. It is owned by the communities themselves. They know that newcomers who feel welcome will contribute to better social outcomes, greater social cohesion and stronger economic growth. Mayor Hamish McDouall, Whanganui: “One key thing is the status of iwi here. We will have a powhiri for new migrants at a local Marae to have Tangata Whenua acknowledge the new people to town”. The programme is about building strong connections between existing community members and newcomers. International evidence tells us that regions working together to welcome newcomers builds a place where everyone feels like they belong. This in turn means newcomers will choose to stay and settle long term in the regions, which helps build shared prosperity and growth for everyone. Ping Peng, Newcomer (China): “Since I started being involved in community work, we established a Chinese community trust, so we feel like we can provide a lot of things to new immigrants”. Ahmed Hessan, Newcomer (Egypt): “When I came here the first place was the Community Centre – they supported us with many things about Palmerston North that you can’t read in books or find in brochures - like the ‘daily life’ stuff”. A network will be created among the communities. They will share what works best for them. Others can learn from the approach, and adopt welcoming practices in their own regions. Peter Grey, Palmerston North Library: “It helps us grow our understanding of the global community that we all belong to, but it also brings a diversity of thought and creativity, which is important for any community”. Mayor Grant Smith, Palmerston North: “I think it’s great that it helps the cities, who are already doing a lot, to just give us that little extra bit more to make these people welcome”. Welcoming Communities brings together local government and community leaders to make the places we love more welcoming for everyone. What is Welcoming Communities?"

Established by the United Nations in 2001, the theme for this year’s World Refugee Day is “a world where refugees are welcomed”. INZ plays a pivotal role in supporting refugees to begin their life in New Zealand, and to settle into the community, Ms Whiteridge says. “This year (1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024) INZ is again on track to meet the Refugee Quota of 1,500 refugees resettled in New Zealand annually. We are also well on our way to meeting the quota of 600 visa applications processed under the Refugee Family Support Category. This category is to support former refugee families by enabling reunification of family members.” INZ works with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to provide safe pathways for the most vulnerable refugees through our Refugee Quota Programme. Refugees are also supported through our Refugee Family Support Category, and the Community Organisation Refugee Sponsorship pilot. This work is underpinned by New Zealand’s Refugee Resettlement Strategy. The vision of the strategy is that former refugees and their families settle successfully, achieve their goals, and thrive in Aotearoa New Zealand. “We cannot achieve this vision alone and we rely on many others – NGOs, volunteers, community groups and other government agencies – to help make this happen,’’ Ms Whiteridge says. “Our Welcoming Communities programme, for example, supports local government, mana whenua and communities to create warm and inclusive environments for newcomers. “Through our programmes, such as those delivered at the Māngere Refugee Resettlement Centre, Te Āhuru Mōwai o Aotearoa, our goal is for former refugees and their families to feel welcome and safe,” she says. “Once at the centre, residents take part in our 5-week resettlement programme. By the time they leave we want to ensure they feel confident and ready to contribute their culture, skills and knowledge to New Zealand. Former refugees and their families bring so much to their new communities.’’ New Zealand’s programme at the Māngere Refugee Resettlement Centre, Te Āhuru Mōwai o Aotearoa, is well-respected internationally, says UNHCR Representative for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, Adrian Edwards. “In 2024 we are facing over 50 conflicts, 120 million people forcibly displaced. There are enormous pressures on the international refugee system, and it is why best-practice examples such as New Zealand’s work at Mangere are becoming more important than ever. The warm welcome refugees receive and the bridges you see being created with the wider New Zealand community is a powerful model for what is possible, what is being achieved, and how creative answers are being found.” Refugee and protection Immigration New Zealand refugee and protection statistics PDF 323KB World Refugee Day 2024 — The UN Refugee Agency Arriving in NZ Settling in NZ Related stories Ubuntu – I am nothing without you After a long journey through camps in Africa and advocating for fellow refugees in Aotearoa New Zealand, Gatluak Chuol is now making a difference through his role at MBIE. 20 June 2024 3 minute read Removal of transit visa requirement for Fijian nationals The requirement for a transit visa for Fijian nationals travelling through New Zealand is being removed. 6 June 2024 1 minute read"

        "main_content": "20 June 2024 3 minute read World Refugee Day is celebrated on 20 June each year – a time to reflect on the courage and resilience of refugees worldwide and the valuable contributions they make to their new homes. This week, we share the life stories of some MBIE hoamahi who come from refugee backgrounds. Gatluak Chuol, Senior Advisor – Community Engagement, in the Refugee and Migrant Support team Immigration New Zealand Te Rōpū Manene, never thought he would be a public servant as he had so much mistrust of government. In fact, he ran away from a corrupt government in his home country of Sudan when he was just 13 years old. After 3 months of walking, fleeing bombing and warfare by day and wildlife such as lions at night, Gatluak spent more than 20 years in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya. In 1999, he met Lilian, a Sudanese refugee, in a Kenyan refugee camp and they married in late 2000. A few years later, the family became separated when Gatluak was supporting UN staff and they got stuck in a war-torn area. In 2004, the family was accepted to come to Aotearoa New Zealand as Quota Refugees, and they arrived without Gat as they believed he had died. Fortunately, Gatluak was able to find his family and in 2015, he arrived in Aotearoa New Zealand to be reunited with his wife and their children. “For a world where refugees are welcomed” After arriving in Aotearoa, Gatluak worked as a community advocate for more than 2 decades, supporting other former refugees to resettle. He loved what he was doing but applied for the Senior Advisor – Community Engagement role in 2023 because he realised that “[his] contribution would make more of a difference within the system rather than outside the system”. His role involves engaging with refugee background communities and supporting refugee resettlement groups. Gatluak particularly enjoys working directly with community leaders in a proactive way, supporting grassroots efforts, empowering communities and ensuring former refugees have a voice. He also likes working within a diverse, multicultural and supportive team. “I am a strong believer of the African ubuntu, which basically means I am nothing without you, that we succeed together,” says Gatluak. “Mahi Tahi reflects this spirit of teamwork. I don’t own the successes in my job because they are a result of collective efforts from colleagues and other people involved.” For Gatluak, “It has always been about people. You live for the future and people are the future.” He enjoys spending time with his wife, Lilian, their four children and their extended family and friends. He is also very involved with his church group. His wife is very proud of him and says, “he’s a kind, caring and generous man who would always help others, especially former refugees. He makes everyone feel welcomed.” Gatluak’s colleagues love working with him, noting he is an excellent team member and the embodiment of the theme of World Refugee Day 2024: “for a world where refugees are welcomed”.

        "main_content": "6 June 2024 1 minute read The Government has announced it will remove the requirement for Fijian nationals to have a transit visa when travelling through New Zealand. We are working to implement this change and expect to complete it in the coming months. We will provide more information when available. In the meantime, Fijian nationals travelling through New Zealand will still need a transit visa. When the transit visa waiver is in place, Fijian nationals will need to apply for a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) to transit New Zealand. Fijian nationals wanting to visit, study or work in New Zealand will still need the appropriate visa before travelling. The fee for an NZeTA is NZD$23 for online applications, or NZD$17 if using the free app. We process requests within 72 hours, and an NZeTA is valid for 2 years.
