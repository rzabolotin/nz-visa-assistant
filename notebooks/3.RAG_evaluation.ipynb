    "# RAG Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we evaluate different RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approaches to determine the most effective method for our task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use questions from ground-truth dataset\n",
    "2. Implement multiple RAG approaches\n",
    "3. Generate responses using each approach\n",
    "4. Measure the performance of each method using different techniques \n",
    "5. Compare the results and select the best-performing approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAG Approaches to Evaluate\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assess the following RAG approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic RAG with a single prompt\n",
    "2. RAG with prompt engineering (multiple variations)\n",
    "3. RAG with different retrieval methods (e.g., semantic search, keyword-based search)\n",
    "4. RAG with different chunking strategies\n",
    "5. RAG with re-ranking of retrieved documents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the effectiveness of each approach, we'll use the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relevance score\n",
    "- Answer correctness\n",
    "- ROUGE score (for text summarization tasks)\n",
    "- Human evaluation (for a subset of responses)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "[Here, you would include code snippets, results tables, and visualizations comparing the performance of different RAG approaches]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our evaluation, we have identified the best-performing RAG approach for our specific task. This approach will be used in our final implementation to ensure optimal results."
