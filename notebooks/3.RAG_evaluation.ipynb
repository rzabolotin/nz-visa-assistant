    "## Evaluation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use questions from ground-truth dataset\n",
    "2. Implement multiple RAG approaches\n",
    "3. Generate responses using each approach\n",
    "4. Measure the performance of each method using different techniques \n",
    "5. Compare the results and select the best-performing approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAG Approaches to Evaluate\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assess the following RAG approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prompt with 5 full articles in context or 10 chunks\n",
    "3. More sophisticated prompt or more simplistic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the effectiveness of each approach, we'll use the following metrics:\n",
    "- LLM-as-a-judge (percent of non-relevant)\n",
