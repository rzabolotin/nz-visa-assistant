# New Zealand Visa Information Chatbot

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the practical application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in creating an interactive and informative chatbot for visa-related queries.  
This project is developed as a final project for the [LLM Zoomcamp course](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/). It aims to create a Telegram chatbot that answers user questions about obtaining a visa for New Zealand, based on information from the official immigration website: https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas


## Project Status

Current status: In progress

### Tasks
- [x] Implement a web scraper to download data from the immigration website and create a JSON file
- [x] Set up docker-compose configuration for building images for indexing and searching
- [ ] Implement indexing data from the JSON file to Elasticsearch
- [ ] Implement a search algorithm for efficient information retrieval
- [ ] Integrate RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using Anthropic's LLM
- [ ] Develop and deploy a Telegram chatbot interface
- [ ] Add License information
- [ ] Adopt parser script for running in a Docker container
- [ ] Parse additional information from https://www.immigration.govt.nz/opsmanual/
- [ ] Draft of the chatbot
- [ ] Transform user's question into a query using LLM (translation and adoption for elasticsearch)


## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Elasticsearch 8.4.3 or compatible version

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Build the Docker images:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. Start the services:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This will start Elasticsearch and the indexer application.

### Indexing Data

To index the scraped data:

1. Ensure your JSON file with the scraped data is in the `./data` directory.

2. Run the indexing command:
   ```
   docker-compose run app python indexer.py index /app/data/your_data_file.json
   ```

Replace `your_data_file.json` with the actual name of your JSON file.

### Running a Search

To perform a search:

```
docker-compose run app python indexer.py search "Your search query here"
```

Replace "Your search query here" with the actual question or query you want to search for.

### Flushing the Index

If you need to clear the index:

```
docker-compose run app python indexer.py flush
```
